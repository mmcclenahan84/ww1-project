Dear Bertie,
Just a few lines to let you know how we are getting on out here, I forgot
when I last wrote you last and what news I told you. We marched down
from the hills, 9,000 feet up in the Himalaya Mountains last October to
Rawalpindi, then shortly afterwards out to camp returning just before
Xmas. In February I obtained a furlough and had a fine tour of places of
interest, down to Delhi then right across India to Calcutta, had several
letters of introduction from brother Freemasons to awfully nice people
there and had a most enjoyable time, spent a few days at Agra on the
return journey, travelled roughly just over 3,000 miles with several nights
in the train. A few days after returning the regiment was placed under
orders to march 83 miles to Noushera on the frontier border, where over
10,000 British and native troops were concentrated, a similar number at
Peshawar farther down the frontier, in readiness for threatened trouble
with the Afghans, whom German intriguers had been amongst. Noushera
was a cruel place, nothing but a dust heap at the foot of the mountain.
We spent several weeks there, training in mountain warfare, my word, it
was chronic, the terrific heat and the awful climbing for miles day after
day, with all transport on mules and camels through the rocky mountain
passes. At one bivouac we encountered bad water, and about forty of our
fellows went down with enteric fever [typhoid]. One died, but the others
pulled through as they had been inoculated; a wonderful thing inoculation
has proved to be in India.
Well in spite of the hard time, we returned to Rawalpindi in fine condition
after the Afghan trouble had subsided for the time being, it is always
liable to break out at any moment and we are always in readiness to
move at any time.
Then we changed to another barracks in Rawalpindi in April, and have
been stationed on the plains all the summer. The heat has been intense;
one never goes outside after 10am; after tiffin at 1 o’clock the barracks
and in fact everywhere is dead to the world until between 5 and 6pm,
when sports such as tennis, cricket hockey and swimming at the baths
are possible.
Every soldier has a punkah (fan) swinging over his bed all night and
during the hours off duty during the day. Many men sleep out on the
barrack square on their beds at night. During the past few weeks the
monsoon has been on, with torrential rain which I would fail to describe.
Now the intense heat of the sun is draining the moisture out of the earth
with the result that it is like living in the moist fern house at Kew
Gardens, only worse, and many men are being bowled over with fever.
Ever since arriving at India, getting on for two years ago, I have been as
fit as a fiddle and enjoyed exceptional health, until a fortnight ago, when I
was suddenly taken ill with sandfly fever, a most painful, lowering form of
fever, and was carried to hospital and also found to be suffering from
pleurisy. I was in bed several days subsisting on a small quantity of milk
with the result that when I was allowed to get up I was too weak to
stand. I was discharged after ten days and am getting on quite alright
now, and am leaving on next furlough to a hill station in the Himalayas
shortly to recuperate. In November we are on the move again, marching
about 80 miles to a big camp, for manoeuvres of several weeks, returning
again just before Christmas. But marching eighty miles in five days under
an Indian sun is very different to cloudy England. Every regiment in India,
both regular and territorial, is being heavily reinforced by drafts from
England. We have had three drafts one consisting of nearly 300 men,
then another of 67, now another of 84, bringing us up to nearly 1,100
men. There are thousands of British troops, mostly Terriers (members of
the Territorial army) (there are only eight regular infantry regiments left
in India) stationed at various frontier places, and all sorts of rumours
prevalent about a big expedition moving during the next few months, all
possible preparations are being made for it, well, if the Indian govt. make
as disastrous a muddle of it when the fighting does come off as they
made over the Mesopotamia campaign, then with foes like the ferocious
Afghans there will be a terrible price to pay in life, for the country and the
terrific heat will be enough without having to fight every inch of the way.
I had a very interesting letter from Mr Wood some time ago which I
answered recently, also had one from Mr Price a few days ago. I can quite
picture the changes which must have occurred in the staff of the Audit
since I left. Of course you are over the age limit, so have not been called
upon. I expect if, and when, I do return safely that life in England will
seem very different under the altered conditions. I shall be glad to get
home again and only wish I could see a prospect of doing so, with the
conclusion of this terrible war. I have had a very enjoyable time in India
(apart from soldiering which I always did enjoy, although I think I have
had sufficient now) having made the acquaintance of awfully nice
residents in ‘Pindi, and by virtue of rank, being allowed the privilege of
wearing mufti makes it so much more comfortable when going out of
barracks than being in a tight uniform in the climate.
I hear regularly from my wife and little one every week. Am glad to say
they are well.
Please convey my kind regards to all those left in the office that I know.
Trusting you are all fit and well and that we shall meet again before many
more months elapse.
With best wishes
Yours most sincerely
Harry Beaumont
