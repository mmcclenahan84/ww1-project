    <p><emotion type="negative">The worst has happened. The War Office has sent us down to this
            place which is miles from nowhere. The camp however is made up of hundreds of huts is
            according to the 'old uns' at the game the finest they have ever been in, <emotion
                type="positive">certainly everything is alright</emotion> but <factor
                type="conditions"> the place is so muddy and my time is split up. One half getting
                frightfully dirty and the other getting myself clean again. <emotion type="positive"
                    >However it's all in the game and can't be helped.</emotion> There are twenty to
                a hut. The beds are three long boards on two trestles about eight or nine inches off
                the floor, a straw mattress and a straw pillow, and four blankets.</factor> Not a
            bit what I have been used to.</emotion>
        <emotion type="positive">However I am now quite comfortable in it and sleep like a top.
            Marvellous how you think we settle down to it. Don't you think?</emotion>
        <factor type="prep">We rise at 6.30am. Breakfast (porridge and bacon) at 7.30. Parade at
            8.20. Drill till 10.30. Then half an hour's rest. Then more drill up to 12.30. Dinner at
            1 o'clock (meat and two vegetables and sweets). Parade again at 2.20. Then more drill
            which brings us up to 4pm. We are then dismissed for the day. Tea at 5pm (bread, butter
            and jam). After which we can do what we like until 9.15. By this time we have to be in
            our huts for the final day's roll call and at 10pm. All lights have to be out. That's
            what my day consists of at present.</factor>
        <emotion type="neutral">It may not seem much, and really it isn't, but I am half the day
            cleaning up.</emotion> The grub is alright but there is not quite enough of it at
        present. <emotion type="positive">I think however this will be right as soon as they have
            made all necessary arrangements.</emotion>
        <factor type="sense">For the time being the Non-Commissioned Officers seem to be a little
            overworked.</factor>
        <factor type="prep">This is the same every day, varied on two mornings a week with a long
            route march in the morning. Of course we only have half a day on Saturday and only a
            Church parade on Sunday.</factor>
        <emotion type="positive">So altogether things are not so bad.</emotion>
        <emotion type="negative">The only thing is I can't get away for weekends, as it would take
            up most of the time to travel to London and back.</emotion> I shall try however and run
        up to town in a few weeks' time if possible.</p>
    <closer> Kind regards to all at 'Omega', and everybody at 164, W.1, including, yourself.
