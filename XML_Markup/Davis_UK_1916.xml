            <p>How are things going with you now? I expect like the rest of us will be glad when the
                better weather sets in for there is no doubt about it, it has been rough lately.</p>
            <p>Since I last wrote to you we have shifted to another part of the line and it is a
                warm shop, for both sides must have all guns they can find and it is nothing but one
                long duel all day and every day but thank goodness it gives over a bit a night so
                that one can get on with their work. You see of a night the flashes of the guns can
                be seen so plainly that is why they do not fire a lot then.</p>
            <p>Just on our right our people retook some trenches we had lost, oh what a rough time
                the poor devils had, snow and mud as much as you like and they had to lay in it for
                two days and grub could not be got to them. I expect there have been a few more from
                Paddington called up by now, it seems if the authorities mean to have all the men
                they want and if they canï¿½t get them one way they will another, and it certainly
                looks as if they will be wanted for out here. One cannot see any signs of an early
                settlement. I see by the papers that the air raids have been busy in England again.
                I suppose you have not seen anything of them yet, has Rory Moore had any more
                frights? We have the taubes [German aircraft] over our hospital nearly every day or
                night and I can tell you we got some starts at times. The nearest we have to them
                since I have been here is just one yard from the main door, at 12.30 it blew in two
                pairs of double doors and shattered on end of the building to bits but not a great
                deal of damage to life which after all is the main thing. The arrangements we in
                work is five or six days up the line and four or five down if you are lucky. Of
                course at times these arrangements go to pot when there is an attack and we get a
                warm time and I should like to enlarge on these things but of course you understand
                I cannot.</p>
            <closer>Give my kind regards to all and trusting you are well. <salute>Yours
