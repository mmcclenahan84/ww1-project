    <p>How are things going with you now? I expect like the rest of us will be glad when the better
        weather sets in for there is no doubt about it, <factor type="conditions">it has been rough
            lately.</factor></p>
    <p>Since I last wrote to you<factor type="prep"> we have shifted to another part of the
            line</factor>
        <factor type="battle">and it is a warm shop, for both sides must have all guns they can find
            and it is nothing but one long duel all day and every day but <emotion type="positive"
                >thank goodness it gives over a bit a night so that one can get on with their
                work.</emotion> You see of a night the flashes of the guns can be seen so plainly
            that is why they do not fire a lot then.</factor>
    </p>
    <p><emotion type="negative">Just on our right our people retook some trenches we had lost, oh
            what a rough time the poor devils had, <factor type="conditions">snow and mud as much as
                you like</factor> and they had to lay in it for two days and grub could not be got
            to them.</emotion> I expect there have been a few more from <name type="place"
            >Paddington</name> called up by now, it seems if the authorities mean to have all the
        men they want and if they can't get them one way they will another, and it certainly looks
        as if they will be wanted for out here. <emotion type="negative">One cannot see any signs of
            an early settlement.</emotion> I see by the papers that the air raids have been busy in
            <name type="place">England</name> again. I suppose you have not seen anything of them
        yet, has <name type="person">Rory Moore</name> had any more frights? <emotion
            type="negative"> We have the taubes [German aircraft] over our hospital nearly every day
            or night and I can tell you we got some starts at times.</emotion>
        <factor type="battle">The nearest we have to them since I have been here is just one yard
            from the main door, at 12.30 it blew in two pairs of double doors and shattered on end
            of the building to bits but not a great deal of damage to life which after all is the
            main thing.</factor> The arrangements we in work is five or six days up the line and
        four or five down if you are lucky. <emotion type="negative">Of course at times these
            arrangements go to pot when there is an attack and we get a warm time and I should like
            to enlarge on these things but of course you understand I cannot.</emotion></p>
    <closer>Give my kind regards to all and trusting you are well. <salute>Yours </salute>
