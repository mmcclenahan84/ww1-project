 <p>Am enclosing a photo of myself, it is, I have been told, not a good likeness, but there it is.
  We have any amount of lectures on the body etc., and presently have to pass an examination, if
  successful the red crosses are issued and also 4d (pennies) per day extra pay. </p>

 <p> Leave is only granted once in nine months and then only six days at the most, in some cases
  only four is given, so I shall not be up yet, but will make a point of course of coming up to
  Paddington when I do get a chance.</p>
 <p><factor type="conditions">Blackpool is a lovely place</factor> and the weather now is <emote
   type="positive">grand</emote>, although the first fortnight was bitterly cold.</p>

 <p>Well I must now close, with a hope to hear from you shortly, please give my kind regards to all
  acquaintances.</p>
