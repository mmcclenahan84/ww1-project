Transcript (extract)
… Am enclosing a photo of myself, it is, I have been told, not a good
likeness, but there it is. We have any amount of lectures on the body etc.,
and presently have to pass an examination, if successful the red crosses
are issued and also 4d (pennies) per day extra pay.
Leave is only granted once in nine months and then only six days at the
most, in some cases only four is given, so I shall not be up yet, but will
make a point of course of coming up to Paddington when I do get a
chance.
Blackpool is a lovely place and the weather now is grand, although the
first fortnight was bitterly cold.
Well I must now close, with a hope to hear from you shortly, please give
my kind regards to all acquaintances.
F. Secrett
