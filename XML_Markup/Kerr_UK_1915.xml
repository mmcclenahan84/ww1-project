            <p>Things have been very quiet hear the last week, with the exception of a little shell
                fire both from the Turks and our own guns. The night before last our fellows made a
                charge on our right flank and took two line of trenches. first of all they blew up
                the Turks trenches and then charged before the dust had time to settle. They cut off
                the Turks in one trench and the others run for their lives leaving their rifles
                behind. They are afraid to face the cold steel. We expect to have some excitement in
                a few days, things are too quiet to last, but I suppose you will read about it in
                the Australian papers. Well Aub I must say good-bye.</p>
