        <factor type="battle">The night before last our fellows made a charge on our right flank and
            took two line of trenches. first of all they blew up the Turks trenches and then charged
            before the dust had time to settle. They cut off the Turks in one trench and the others
            run for their lives leaving their rifles behind. They are afraid to face the cold
            steel.</factor>
