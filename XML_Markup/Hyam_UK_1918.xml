            <p>Have arrived in India for the purpose of relieving some A1 (military fitness category
                meaning capable of active service overseas) men here who have been here for a long
                period. It's not a bad show here just above Delhi but so d____d hot: risen to 106
                degrees in the shade and we have more hot weather just coming. Our parades are as
                follows 6.30-7.45 and 9 to 10 and finish for day. There is an abundance of sport and
                grub here. Fancy getting eggs laid too. A supper of say new mutton chop, potatoes,
                peas, broccoli and tea 4d.</p>
            <p>The things that are expensive are goods from England especially English soap, sauces,
                writing paper and of course we are unable to get English made fags. We had a grand
                journey from England; route was Southampton to Cherbourg then to Italy. In Italy we
                went to Alexandria, stayed there three days had a grand time, streets of red lamps
                etc. and lovely shops. No two houses in main stretch are alike. Then from Alexandria
                we come to Port Suez by train then on P. and O. Liner Kaiser I. Hind to Bombay had
                two days there and that's a grand place too, lovely wide streets and grand
                buildings. They have a sea front very much like Hastings and all the big boys have
                their after dinner drive there and form a queue by shore. Some stuff there too. Lots
                of Europeans knocking about too. Had a game of footer for the Railway Operatives
                depot last night, 6pm, with Kingls Own and won. But it was so ruddy warm and I felt
                like a wash out at finish</p>.
