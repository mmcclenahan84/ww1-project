        <salute>Dear <name type="person">Mr Welsh</name>,</salute>
    </opener>
    <p>A lot has happened since I last wrote to you and <factor type="prep">we have moved, and
            moved, and moved again, and still we are moving. There is nothing at all to say about
            the actual coming off. We were told to pack up, and having done so, were marched off and
                <emotion type="positive">soon afterwards were making up a four for Bridge in quite a
                comfortable cabin and enjoying the unwanted luxury of electric
            light</emotion></factor>.</p>
    <p><emotion type="neutral">The only thing that struck one in coming away was that nothing had
            altered and it might easily have been the night I landed. The same old beach apparently
            full up with boxes of bully beef, tinned milk and jam, <factor type="battle">the same
                old destroyer, with its search light playing on the shore, keeping up its systematic
                bombardment and the same old swish of bullets around and dropping into the
                water.</factor></emotion>
        <factor type="prep">No sooner was Christmas here than we were packing up again, to come on
            here.</factor> A large town a few miles on the interior, <emotion type="negative"
                ><factor type="sense">it is a filthy rotten smelly hole</factor> and we always
            carried loaded revolvers and walked about in batches and were never out after dark.
            Probably the people are not ill disposed to us but some of them looked pretty villainous
            and it was better to be on the safe side</emotion>.</p>
    <p><emotion type="positive">We have had quite a good time and the regular hours and regular
            meals have backed everyone up well and now we are all as fit as ever
            apparently.</emotion> Thanks very much for the Xmas card <emotion type="negative">it was
            a bit late but then all our Xmas letters and parcels were on account of the way we have
            been moving about; we lost a good mail, too, on the Persia (S.S. Persia, which was
            torpedoed and sunk in <date when="1915-12">December 1915</date>).</emotion> I am enclosing a few photos that might
        be of interest to you. I have some more snaps coming later on and will let you have some if
        they turn out to be any good.</p>
    <closer> With kind regards. <salute>Yours sincerely,</salute>
