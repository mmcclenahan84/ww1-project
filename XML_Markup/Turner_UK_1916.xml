Dear Jim (Mr Porter)
Just a few lines to let you now things are going. Am having a fairly good
time nothing at all to grumble about. I don’t think I shall be going to
France for a few months yet. I met one of the chaps from the tickets
department last week he is in the R.F.C. down here. Some of us were feet
under canvas for a fortnight but owing to the wind and rain we were
moved back to the huts. When we were under canvas, we used not get up
till 8 o’clock, we were supposed to go on parade at 6.15am, but we
dodged that. I enclose photo (not dressed for the occasion) outside our
hut L20 or Hell 20 as it has been called. I am looking forward to seeing
some of the office chaps when I am able to get leave. I hope your brother
is getting on alright in France. Hoping you are ‘in the pink’ like myself,
Yours very sincerely
F. Turner. Please write as soon as poss.
