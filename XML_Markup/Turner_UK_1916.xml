        <salute>Dear Jim (Mr Porter)</salute>
    </opener>
    <p>Just a few lines to let you now things are going. <emote type="positive">Am having a fairly
            good time</emote> nothing at all to grumble about. I dont think I shall be going to
        France for a few months yet. I met one of the chaps from the tickets department last week he
        is in the R.F.C. down here. Some of us were <factor type="sense">feet under canvas for a
            fortnight </factor>but owing to the <factor type="conditions">wind and rain</factor> we
        were moved back to the huts. When we were under canvas, we used not get up till 8 oclock, we
        were supposed to <factor type="prep">go on parade at 6.15am</factor>, but we dodged that. I
        enclose photo (not dressed for the occasion) outside our hut L20 or Hell 20 as it has been
        called. <emote type="neutral">I am looking forward to seeing some of the office
            chaps</emote> when I am able to get leave. I hope your brother is getting on alright in
        France. Hoping you are in the pink like myself,</p>
