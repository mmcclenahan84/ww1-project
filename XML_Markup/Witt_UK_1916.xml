Dear G. [Mr Burgoyne],
I guess you wonder what has become of me after this long silence, but
you will see I am a good distance away from the homeland now. I arrived
here early in April and since the start have been getting on quite well. You
may be interested to know that Gray from your department is also here.
It is rather strange that I should rub against him.
The weather is brilliant, cloudless skies day after day, but it is very hot.
There are plenty of mosquitoes about. They are very tantalising. A net is
practically a necessity for sleeping purposes. I am billeted in a warehouse,
it is a very old place, and has stood hundreds of years. I should think,
according to its general appearance.
I have not picked up the lingo yet, but French is chiefly spoken, and I
much regret not having studied it more when I had the opportunity at
home. This town is a queer sort of place as compared with some of the
French towns we know, and am sure I shall not wish to see it again when
once I leave. The cafés are not so gay as the French, but I manage to
have fun occasionally. We have got a piano and gramophone to amuse
ourselves with. I hope we shall be able to have another trip to Paris, when
the war has cleared up, but of course when is a question nobody can
answer yet awhile. Shall be very pleased to hear some news of you, and
conclude now with all the best.
Yours sincerely, Frank.
