        <salute>Dear G. [Mr Burgoyne],</salute>
    </opener>
    <p>I guess you wonder what has become of me after this long silence, but you will see I am a
        good distance away from the homeland now. I arrived here early in April and since the start
        have been getting on quite well. You may be interested to know that Gray from your
        department is also here. It is rather strange that I should rub against him.</p>

    <p>The weather is brilliant, cloudless skies day after day, but it is very hot. There are plenty
        of mosquitoes about. They are very tantalising. A net is practically a necessity for
        sleeping purposes. I am billeted in a warehouse, it is a very old place, and has stood
        hundreds of years. I should think, according to its general appearance.</p>

    <p>I have not picked up the lingo yet, but French is chiefly spoken, and I much regret not
        having studied it more when I had the opportunity at home. This town is a queer sort of
        place as compared with some of the French towns we know, and am sure I shall not wish to see
        it again when once I leave. The cafs are not so gay as the French, but I manage to have fun
        occasionally. We have got a piano and gramophone to amuse ourselves with. I hope we shall be
        able to have another trip to Paris, when the war has cleared up, but of course when is a
        question nobody can answer yet awhile. Shall be very pleased to hear some news of you, and
        conclude now with all the best.</p>

        <salute>Yours sincerely,</salute>
