                <salute>Dear <name type="person">Bertie</name>,</salute>

            <p>Many thanks for your long and interesting letter, which has now reached me, I will to
                it at length at a more opportune moment. As you will see by above address I have
                left India. The regiment left the N.W. Indian frontier in January where the winter
                had been bitterly cold and embarked at Karachi after a three day�s train journey,
                then six day�s most pleasant voyage to Aden where we landed and now join part of the
                Aden Field Force. I have been stationed with a strong detachment on the desert in
                close proximity to a Turkish force who frequently shelled us, but without any
                material damage. The heat after the cold winter in India is very trying, scorching
                hot sun, endless sand and myriads of torturing flies. Life is very different here as
                compared to India. I never pictured myself riding across the Arabian dessert on a
                camel. Am pleased to say I am splendidly fit and well, but should be glad when the
                struggle is over and hope I shall be amongst those who return home safely. Trusting
                you are well.</p>
