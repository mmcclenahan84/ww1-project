Henry James Marsh
from Indian Oceane
14th January, 1917
to England.

Dear Bob,
Now for another budget concerning this trip so far.
Well, I left Brisbane on the 21st Dec. at 6.30 A.M. by train for Sydney, arrived at Roma Street at 7 A.M. changed engines for a B.17 and then started on our long journey.
The farewell at that Station is something that shall never be forgotten by most men on that train.
My people couldn't get into Brisbane to see me as the train I was on left too early before the train from Wynnum arrived in Brisbane,
so I said a final good-bye the night before. I shall never forget that particular night.
I always though it took something very awful to break me up, but that night broke me up completely.
I would give anything now to have just a look at my dear home and parents, but the ship is taking me further away each kick with the propeller.
Anyhow I am looking forward in the future to seeing Wynnum and my parents after I have done my duty at the front.
In camp at Enoggera is a splendid life to be at: he can go where he likes, but when once you leave for the front you are tied down to orders,
now one has to be a dinkum soldier, I can see how it is one doesn't want to enlist, but I do not dislike the game,
I am only giving you the idea of the whole concern so far as I have seen of it.
