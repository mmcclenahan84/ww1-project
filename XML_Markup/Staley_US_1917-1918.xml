'Army City' Garnett, Kansas  August 6, 1917
My Dearest Mary,
We are in the Army now. I am sitting inside our little old tent listening to the gentle patter of the raindrops on the canvas. It began raining here this morning and it is still at it. No drill today, so I will have time to write a letter or two. We got into the city all O.K., marched up to the armory and had dinner. They have mess in the armory. We have to march back and forth to eat. Eats are pretty good so far as they have some women helping with the cooking.
Set up camp in the afternoon. Shoemaker has been Acting Corporal in our squad. We got the tent up all right under the direction of one of the old heads who has seen service on the border. Some equipment was issued in the afternoon. As my name is down well in the list, I have not received anything yet in my own name.
Corporal Hilton is staying in town so he let me have his stuff. Got pack, gun, poncho, and numerous other things I don't know what are used for. Slept on the ground last night in a tent with just an even dozen in it. Some of the fellows are staying in town at hotels, rooming houses, and private houses. Taken altogether, things are in rather poor shape as yet, but I suppose it takes a little time to get around. A few of the bunch act like a bunch of bums instead of soldiers, but they will get that taken out of them when they get to a real camp.
They got Parker Melliush for kitchen duty the first thing. Walter Anthony was stuck for guard duty last night. It must be fine walking up and down in front of a row of tents watching the other fellows sleep. One thing they did do, everybody had to quiet down at ten-thirty last night. We had a good entertainment before lights out. (We had a light, too, as some of the bunch got hold of a lantern.) A fellow in our squad by the name of Donald gets off some pretty good comedy -- original stuff, too. He is a rather rough nut, but not as bad as some of this crowd.
There was some crowd at the station yesterday, wasn't there? I think I shook hands with everybody in town three or four times. Not a very pleasant task under the circumstances, either. Well, I got so much company in here that I can't think straight. This is rather a poor excuse of a letter, but I will write again soon.
With best of love to my own little girl,
Lloyd S.

        My Dearest Mary,
        I write this on board a boat that will leave for overseas soon. Our letters are all censored from now on so there is no use wasting my time and the censor's trying to tell you some things.
        I took in a little of New York last night. I went into the city from Long Island by the way of the tube under the Hudson River. I got out at the Pennsylvania station and spent the rest of the night to 1:30 a.m. just looking around. There wasn't any chance to go to a good show because you know how the advance sales take everything. Harry LauderA British singer noted for his comic stage persona. is at the Metropolitan and I would certainly like to have seen him.
        I saw where the film "The Beast of Berlin" was being shown and right across the street was Arthur Guy Empey, "Over the Top."A Broadway show based on a best-selling book.
        The city is full of soldiers and sailors all the time, I guess. Anyway there were a good many last night.
        The city is an easy place to get lost because of the irregularity of the streets. Most all streets out our way cross each other at angles but in N.Y. they may take any direction. I walked down one street and when I took a notion to turn and go back, I wasn't on the same street at all and I couldn't tell where I made any turn.
        I got a good look at the city from the waterfront today. It was a bright clear day and we could see quite a distance. I have seen pictures of N.Y. from the Hudson and I can say that the real thing was just a picture laid before you. I would like to have stayed at Camp Mills until I had seen more of the city but the powers that be see otherwise.
        I can scarcely realize we are going. Everything moves off without any trouble or delay that it might just as well be a trip up the river.
        Well, I have been looking forward to this for quite a while and I guess, now that the time for going has come, it fits right into my scheme and ways of thinking that the going seems only a small part of it.
        Well, I must close so as to mail this right away so, goodbye little girl for a time at least. Keep on writing.
        With truest love, Lloyd M. Staley
        My address: Co. K, 137 Infantry, American Expeditionary Forces

    My Dearest Mary,
    I received my first mail since I have gotten across yesterday. Two letters from you are dated April 19 and the other April 22. The first one was written before you had heard my N.Y. address and the other was addressed to Camp Mills. They were indeed highly appreciated letters and I believe that I can look for more right soon as the mail has begun to come now. There were two other letters for me also; one from Mother and Ethel,Ethel (Graves) Staley, wife of Lloyd's brother Glenn. the other from James.Probably James Gasaway, a boyhood friend. The last was of the most recent date: May 6. This was certainly an excited company when we found out there was so much mail for us. Almost everyone got at least one letter and a few were as fortunate as myself.
    I was rather surprised to hear that Robert Robert was Mary's brother. was going into the R.F.C.Royal Flying Corps.  The British air force. although you had told me of it, too. But to know that he had already left for camp and by the time you get this letter he will probably be in England was just a bit of a surprise. Well, I am glad that he is in the service but, of course, I would like to have seen him in a uniform of the U.S.A. It is all one cause, however, and we are comrades just the same whether American, English, or what. I have seen some mighty fine men from Britain just what short time I have been here. (My pen went dry and I haven't any ink at my elbow as I did in U.S.) Speaking of the English, it is wonderful how men can go through three and four years of this war and still be smiling, cheerful, good-natured fellows, but they are. I agree with Robert when he says there will be two classes of men in America after the war -- the ones who went, and the ones who did not. And I believe as he does the ones who went are going to be the ones who will have charge of affairs when they get back for, if a man stands this war and still comes out smiling, he is a man. I certainly hope I may have a chance of seeing Robert over here but it would be only an accident I am afraid. Let me know his address from time to time so if there is any way of seeing him, I will do all I can to find him.
    You must have a nice home now and right in your old neighborhood. And those fruit trees take my eye. I believe I could consume your total production right now. Some of these times we will sample that fruit and also stroll over to Swope Park and look things over considerably after the war, apres la guerre, as the French say. Whenever you say anything to them about certain things they can't do now, they always say "after the war," and I think that little expression shows to what extremes they are willing to go in self sacrifice. I certainly have a very high opinion of the French. They are most highly respected by the American soldiers and they return the compliment.
    To sit here where I am now, it seems scarcely possible that we are so near the front. This country here is a peaceful-looking farming country and, to look out over the quiet fields, it is hard to realize that the fighting is so close at hand. To walk across these fields is just like taking a stroll over Dad's farm on some quiet Sunday afternoon. Only there are several things that are conspicuously absent -- most of all the folks that were left behind. The ones that you love and are loved by is what goes to make life worthwhile.
    Well, the sound of the big guns somewhere not so many miles away has begun again. Sometimes the sound comes from one side, then the other, until it is hard to tell which way one could go and not find someone shooting at someone else. My address is the same: Co. K, 137th Inf., Amer. E.F. I expect you know it by this time but some of my letters may drop by the wayside so it is best to be sure for I certainly want to get all the mail that is coming to me.
    So, goodbye to the little girl who has given up two loved ones so cheerfully and sent them away with the smile that counts.
    With sincerest love, Lloyd
    (Tell Aunt JessJessie (Lamb) Townsend, Lloyd's mother's sister. I will write her soon. I am glad that you two have become such good friends.)
    
    P.S. I have received another letter from you since I wrote the fore part of this letter. It was dated April 25. Also I got one from Mother dated May 10. It was marked No. 2.... suppose No. 1 was sidetracked somewhere along the line. This is the second letter I have written you since going into our billets.A billet is lodging for troops. The other was not dated at all, maybe this one won't be when you get it but I am risking it anyway. Mother said my first letter written on the boat got by without being cut up. It had no cause for being cut up as I said almost nothing as most of my letters do, but wait until I can tell you. I will have some tale.
    Well, goodnight sweetheart, Lloyd

        June 24, 1918
        My Dearest Mary,
        It is about time to write again and, as I feel rather in the humor and have the time, I will proceed without any further delay.
        I am still in the same place as I told you in the last letter -- at the Brigade post office and the four of us are the only ones left in this town. I mean Americans, of course. We are having quite a time as we are our own cooks and are ruled by our own sweet wills. I can't say that it will be so pleasant, though, if we are here for a few days more than we are expecting. Anything to eat is awfully hard to get, especially if you are a soldier. The Army is supposed to feed us, you know, and everything outside the Army is for civilians and God knows they need what little they can get. The people here, two or three men, cleaned up the building used for storage of supplies in order to get what might be left behind. They thought they made a good bargain, too, and I suppose the Americans did leave more than the French ever do.
        Oh yes, I meant to tell you what we had for breakfast and all this was cooked by the corporal in charge and what assistance I could give. We had fried eggs, we bought some from a Frenchwoman, steak, Army issue, we got a half-cooked chunk of beef from the Company we ate with, butter or oleo, strawberry jam, bread, and coffee. Bread was Army bread, white bread, too, and about one hundred percent better than the French people eat. That was not so bad, was it, for an Army meal. I only wish I could have one like it every day.
        Our office is right next to the schoolhouse and we often talk with the schoolmaster, make signs or any other way to communicate. They have separate rooms for boys and girls over here and the children that get to school at this place are no larger than would compare with our attendants of the third or fourth grade. I don't know whether that is as far as they expect the children to go or not. The schoolroom looks a great deal like any schoolroom. The benches or seats are longer than ours -- they must seat two or three together. The room has an abundance of maps, pictures, and blackboards. They seem to study the geography of France but little of any other part of the world. We were much interested in the map of France as we wished to see where we had been in our journey and I must say I was very much surprised at how much we had really covered. I sure want to tell you all about it one of these days. Just take that big map we so often have studied and talk until we can't talk anymore and then just take you in my arms and kiss those sweet rosy lips again. Well, they talk of the girl that was left behind, for my part I can see you just as plain as I ever did and you look a thousand times more dear to me now and someday we will be the happiest boy and girl that there possibly can be anywhere in the world.
        I haven't had a letter from you for over a week now but I can't get my mail as I should. It goes out to the Company and I can't get to the Company. This idea of working in a post office and then can't get your own mail is some idea. I am going to have you send my letters directed to the 69th Brigade, P.O. 35th Division, American Expeditionary Forces. Then if I change again soon, I will immediately let you know.
        Well, it is getting close to dinnertime and I must help get dinner -- we are regular cooks now. Tell me all and everything that you possibly can write as I sure love to read your letters more than anything else, unless it is writing ones for you to read.
        By the way, I read that story in the April American yesterday. It was the luckiest thing I ever got hold of one. You asked me to read "Pictures Burned in My Memory" I believe and I must say that, as far as I have gone in this business, that story certainly tells the straight stuff. I used to think that a lot of such stories were written by men with highly colored imaginations but I see now that they could tell even more and still be speaking the truth.
        This must be "fini" or I will miss out on the eats and that can't be done with impunity in the Army. So, goodbye for a little while my own little sweetheart.
        With sincerest truest love,
        Lloyd

        July 31, 1918
        My Dearest Mary,
        Well, I have had another letter from you since I wrote last. This one was dated June 30. It takes about that much time, it seems, for a letter to get to us. Also, I had one from Mother of about the same date. You two seem to write about the same dates every time and when I get a letter from one, I can almost always expect one from the other right soon.
        We have moved again but not far this time. Moved on my favorite moving day, Sunday, or rather the day the Army has picked for me so many times. We have our office in an old barn of some sort. Quite a drop from sorting mail on a billiard table. The floor is so rickety here that we are in danger of going through every time we make any movements. Also, I may say the ventilating system is good -- extra good -- and the elevator going down is in perfect working order. I forgot to state our office was on the second floor. The lighting system is rather poor, though. I intend to see the landlord about it soon but I am afraid we would have a hard time "comprening" each other and I don't know the sign language for more light yet.
        I just came from K Co. and everyone there seems to be in good health and the best of spirits. Brought a letter back for Shoemaker, to go out tomorrow. Shoey is working in the kitchen now and, from all appearances, he is getting lots to eat. I suppose they will be moving up to the trenches again as soon as they have been out the usual time.
        I am going to send you an issue of the Stars and StripesA weekly armed forces magazine. as soon as I have finished reading it. This is the A.E.F. paper and I think that you will be pleased to see what sort of a paper it is. This paper is not the regular newspapers we get but sort of a sheet that reflects the A.E.F. spirit. Our news sources are the Paris edition of the N.Y. Herald, Chicago Tribune, and the Daily Mail. The last is an English paper put out by the London Daily Mail.
        Found where there is a ruin of an old castle and as soon as I find the time I am going to see what there is to see there. It is on a small hill that rises rather abruptly out of the valley and, from the looks of things from the ground, it is indeed a hard place to reach even now. Those old timers were fond of such sites I have been told. The fellow that picked this place, picked a good one, too.
        Heard from Doug a few days before I got your last letter. He seems to be in the best of spirits and he hears from Joe I. occasionally, too. He says she is in Washington D.C. working for my able employer. Well, he has a lot of jobs open, it seems, from the way the revised draft classification looks. That one took a lot of boys that were not expecting anything just yet.
        Oh! I must tell you I saw Becker a night or so ago. He showed me a letter he had from Robert and, as a return favor, I gave him the one I had from Doug. Don't misunderstand me and think that is our regular custom in the Army. That is the exception rather than the rule.
        Well, it is getting late so I suppose it would be best for me to ring off for this time. So, goodnight once again, little girl. I have often wondered how long these goodnights will be said this way, but it is all for the best and one of these days... Well, it will be some day. So, goodnight to my own little sweetheart.
        Yours with sincerest love, Lloyd
