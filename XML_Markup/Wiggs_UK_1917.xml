        <salute>Dear Mr Smith,</salute>
    </opener>
    <p>I hope you will accept my apology for not writing before. It has not been want of will it has
        been lack of opportunity. I wonder how you all are. <emote type="positive">I am fairly well
            now</emote> but was <emote type="negative">very queer for several weeks
            recently.</emote> I also often wonder how you are all getting on and should like to
        hear.</p>

    <p>A matter of about five minutes ago Fritz was <factor type="battle">bombing</factor> us, and I
        have just got up off <factor type="sense">the ground where I was laying for about twenty
            minutes</factor>. <factor type="sense">One fellow has been hit</factor>, but not
        severely by shrapnel. This is his second visit this evening.</p>

    <p>It will soon be twelve months since I left you. <emote type="neutral">It seems a very long
            time ago.</emote> I am afraid I have very little I may tell you, so will conclude by
        asking you to accept my best wishes for the New year and desiring that you will remember me
        kindly to any enquiring friends. Believe me, dear Mr Smith,</p>

    <closer>
        <salute>sincerely yours,</salute>
