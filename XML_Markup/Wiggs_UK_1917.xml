Dear Mr Smith,
I hope you will accept my apology for not writing before. It has not been
want of will it has been lack of opportunity. I wonder how you all are. I
am fairly well now but was very queer for several weeks recently. I also
often wonder how you are all getting on and should like to hear.
A matter of about five minutes ago Fritz was bombing us, and I have just
got up off the ground where I was laying for about twenty minutes. One
fellow has been hit, but not severely by shrapnel. This is his second visit
this evening.
It will soon be twelve months since I left you. It seems a very long time
ago. I am afraid I have very little I may tell you, so will conclude by
asking you to accept my best wishes for the New year and desiring that
you will remember me kindly to any enquiring friends. Believe me, dear
Mr Smith, sincerely yours,
W. Wiggs
