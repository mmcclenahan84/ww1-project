        <salute>Dear Jack</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>Your very welcome letter to hand a couple of days ago.</p>
    <p><emote type="positive">I am pleased to hear that the strike is settled</emote> and that you lost no time. Well Jack you say
        that there seems to be a bit of a mystery about us chaps well since the <factor type="prep">evacuation</factor>, last
        December we have been tossed about a bit &amp; have had <factor type="prep">three trips across the Meditterean</factor>
        so I reckon that I have been pretty lucky in not meeting any German submarines.</p>
    <p>My last trip was from Alexandria to Marceilles, which took six days and then straight out of
        the boat into the train for another 68 hours ride across France. <emote type="positive">My word Jack it was a
        lovely <factor type="conditions">train journey</factor></emote> we passed through some beautiful country but I will tell you all about
        it when I get home again but its hard to say when that will be. Well Jack this is Easter
        Monday we are moving into the <factor type="battle">trenches</factor> tonight so we will be able to find out for our-selves
        what sort of fighters the Germans are perhaps I will be able to tell you a bit about them in
        my next letter.</p>
    <p>Well Jack you dont mention what batt your Brother is attached to so next time you write dont
        forget to let me know as I would only be to pleased to meet him. I say Jack you will have to
        excuse scribbling as I haven't much time so I will have to close with best wishes to
        yourself and wife and all the engine room staff.</p>
