        <salute>Dear Jack</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>Your very welcome letter to hand a couple of days ago.</p>
    <p>I am pleased to hear that the strike is settled and that you lost no time. Well Jack you say
        that there seems to be a bit of a mystery about us chaps well since the evacuation, last
        December we have been tossed about a bit &amp; have had three trips across the Meditterean
        so I reckon that I have been pretty lucky in not meeting any German submarines.</p>
    <p>My last trip was from Alexandria to Marceilles, which took six days and then straight out of
        the boat into the train for another 68 hours ride across France. My word Jack it was a
        lovely train journey we passed through some beautiful country but I will tell you all about
        it when I get home again but its hard to say when that will be. Well Jack this is Easter
        Monday we are moving into the trenches tonight so we will be able to find out for our-selves
        what sort of fighters the Germans are perhaps I will be able to tell you a bit about them in
        my next letter.</p>
    <p>Well Jack you dont mention what batt your Brother is attached to so next time you write dont
        forget to let me know as I would only be to pleased to meet him. I say Jack you will have to
        excuse scribbling as I haven't much time so I will have to close with best wishes to
        yourself and wife and all the engine room staff.</p>
