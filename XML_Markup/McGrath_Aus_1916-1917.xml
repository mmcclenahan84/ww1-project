            <salute>My dear old Jack &amp; Clare,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p> Got your (Jacks) letter of 23 April to day &amp; got one from Clare a couple of weeks
            ago. Well Im glad to see that things are all well so far. Very sorry to hear about Ted
            &amp; I hope he has fully recovered by this. Also that he was not out of work long
            through it all. My word the kidlets must be growing. I suppose they are "some" handful
            by now. Hope the Arbitration award panned out satisfactorily to all concerned. Give my
            love to Ede Al &amp; all of the folk. Uncle Will wrote &amp; told me they had had a
            splendid trip up you way as far as Mt Morgan. He was then off to Mildura for a few days.
            I wrote you all a post card last week. Remember me to Bob Anderson &amp; tell him Ill
            write shortly. My word the works must be like old times with all those hands up there.
                <factor type="conditions">I am out in the desert</factor> still &amp; at present
            with another officer &amp; two troops stationed well out. <emote type="positive">We are
                having a glorious time</emote> as far as soldiering goes, and appear to be quite
            safe from any attacks. Of course everyone wants something to happen, but that sort of
            skite comes from the new bloods. All the old hands recognise the good wicket they are on
            &amp; say nix.</p>

        <p>Our horses are in good nick &amp; get well looked after. <emote type = "neutral">The <factor type = "conditions">desert sun is very hot</factor> but
            we have managed to get a little shelter rigged here</emote> &amp; there, which proves a great
            boon. Rations are good as can be &amp; we are having a real good turn. Of course weve
            earned it. Ive got three splendid nags &amp; you can bet were good pals. Ive picked up a
            good knowledge of horses here &amp; do some enjoyable rides. We are too far from the
            canal for swimming but will get a turn there bye &amp; bye. There have been one or two
            stunts of which the papers will have published in detail ere this. A week or so ago an
            aeroplane flew over one of the L.H. camps &amp; <factor type = "battle">dropped fifteen bombs</factor> accounting for 9
            men &amp; 14 horses killed. It was "No man standing" for a few jiffs. Of course he
            caught them at stables so was able to do a double shift &amp; get away. <emote type = "neutral">The desert is
            not very interesting</emote> from a physical aspect, but it is marvellous to see the wonderful
            hiding places to be found everywhere in it. Everything is sand &amp; the wind makes some
            tremendous mounds &amp; some equally tremendous hollows. I have seen hollows quite two
            hundred feet deep. </p>
        <p>I saw Walter Barrett but he has gone to France for sure by this. He looked well &amp; was
            very keen on it. You might remember me to Allie. Has W.K. arrived that way yet. Im so
            sorry all the boys got out of work &amp; I guess Mother had a bad time of it. Hope she
            is alright now. Tell Clare I havent had a chance to see that Aunt of hers, but will do
            so if I get a chance. We are about 50 miles across desert from Port Said, so you see I
            might see her ere long. Lizzie is in Adelaide. Her letters are very gloomy, and she
            seems very dissatisfied all round. Im very sorry, but were in this now till were let
            out, so its about time she got that view of it. She hasnt been at all short of money in
            any way &amp; ought to be putting on a brighter face than her letters indicate. Young
            Will is evidently a boshter. I got several letters from people in the Hill. One from Geo
            Robinson containing real spicy congratulation from Jim Hebbard. He reckons Im right on a
            royal welcome from him if he ever sees me again, so that was rather cheering.</p>

        <p>Well old man thats about all this time. Ill have such a lot to tell you when I come home
            that youll wish it could have been your luck to come. However your job is at home as Ive
            told you in most of my previous efforts. Things are looking bright for me in several
            ways. When I get back &amp; if they do well both you &amp; Ted will get the call. So in
            the meantime look well after Clare, the kiddies, &amp; yourself with ever grateful love
            to you both from </p>

        <p>Just a note as we are on the move for another camp &amp; <emote type = "negative">things are upside down</emote>. Got a
            letter from you last mail &amp; judge that you have been having a rough time. Gee-whiz
            but you must have a few howling matches there occasionally. Hope dear old Clare is OK
            also Allie K. Give Clare my love. Also tell her that I wrote to Mrs Dye &amp; she has
            invited me up to Pt Said. As things are now of course I cant get away just for a while.
            We are expecting to be brawling with Johnny Turk &amp; hope to give him a load or two.
            <factor type = "prep">Things are greatly stirred here just now</factor>. Any way, the Devil looks after his own so have
            no fear &amp; expect a line of more length shortly from your lovingly</p>

        <p>Just a short note to let you know <emote type = "positive">Im still going strong</emote> &amp; feeling hale &amp; hearty.
            You will have read in the papers during the past few weeks of us having been in a bit of
            a go &amp; making some captures, well we are still a long way away from any fixed camp
            or convenience &amp; will probably be in this state for another month. <factor type = "battle">The fighting
            seems to have settled</factor> right out &amp; no Turks about worth speaking of. We are camped
            out near to where we had our last fight as our horses couldnt have gone much further at
            the pace we had to work. My word it is the first big Light Horse work of the war and it
            has been most interesting throughout. I only wish we have more stunts like it. <factor type = "battle">Our
            casualties were not very great</factor> &amp; its surprising in open country how much lead it
            takes to pot a man. You would like to see the date oases. Just now all the dates are
            ripe &amp; there are tons &amp; tons everywhere. The country here is soft drift sand for
            miles &amp; miles &amp; then in the hollows one drops on a clump of palms (4 or 5 acres
            as a rule). Can get water almost any where at a depth of 2 ft and although brackish
            quite good &amp; drinkable so you see desert work is not so arduous as the story books
            make out. Of course there are plenty of drawbacks, but what are we here for?</p>

        <p>Certainly theres any amount of growling but you can bet your life its not too bad at all,
            at all. Got a cheery letter from Ede &amp; Phil the other day. They seem on a good
            wicket &amp; also mention that things are alright with you &amp; Al. I guess youre kept
            busy old man, but keep going. I hope to be a help to you when I get back, which may not
            be so long now Rumania is in. As for Al &amp; Ted give them my best love &amp; tell them
            I hope to be able to "do a bit" when I get back. I wrote to Mrs Dye &amp; got a very
            kind invitation to Port Said, but owing to beinginvitedon this stunt, I couldnt get
            there. I think Mrs Dye will have left for India ere this. She was due to leave about a
            month ago. Im sorry as I would liked to have met them. Give Clare my fondest regards
            also all the kiddies. My word they must be growing up. Hope Clare is absolutely OK. Also
            Alice. Got a letter from Vera Godkin. They all seem well. Lizzie is going well &amp;
            young Wills last photo showed him as a fine boy. They are in Adelaide. Well old boss,
            more later. Paper very scarce just at present. Remember me to Bob and Bess Anderson will
            you also my old friends. Got a real splendid message from Jim Hebbard &amp; the Central
            chaps two mails ago. Well old man you know the good things I wish you both adieu till we
            meet again</p>

        <p>Got an undated letter from you today but should think it was posted in September. My word
            old horse you sound cheerful but you are not having the best of time. However I hope the
            furnaces are now going O.K. again &amp; things are straightening. I am sending you along
            a fiver for Xmas &amp; hope it arrives safely to give you &amp; the kids a day out in
            commemoration. Dear old Clare I hope she is doing well. I had made full arrangements to
            call on Mrs Dye but <factor type = "battle">the Turks came</factor> &amp; I did not see. I think she has now gone to
            India but will find out for certain soon as we are now in a camp having arrived here
            yesterday evening. <emote type = "positive">Its great to be <factor type = "conditions">in a tent</factor> again</emote> &amp; tomorrow I hope to have the
            luxury of sleeping in a bed even if it is only made of feed-bags. You can guess it will
            go alright after not having seen one for three months. Tell Clare she neednt growl about
            her luck. <emote type = "negative">We suffer here with <factor type = "conditions">too little bed</factor></emote>. Glad the kidlets are doing so well. Yes I
            would like a snap of them very much. Sorry Barrett is wounded &amp; hope its nothing
            very serious. I had heard about Annie Gainer. Its bad luck but it looks almost like a
            judgment. Give my love to Ede &amp; Al &amp; the other tribes. You didnt mention Al or
            Ted. Hope they are going alright. Am sending Al along a couple of quidlets for Xmas.</p>

        <p>I am going to a Cavalry School for a course on Monday. Its quite a new thing &amp; at
            present only meant for senior officers. I feel quite favored at being sent along &amp;
            you can bet Im a trier. Will let you know how I get on. Its at Cairo. We are still miles
            out in the desert so of course it will be quite a good change too. The square head is
            getting it hot now. Next summer will see it all over. The smaller fry will peter out
            &amp; then well get the Kaisers push. Its just a case of time tells only the push hurts
            the longer it goes. Jacko has left this country pretty well but hell still be a nuisance
            for some time. Theyll all go though before this time next year. Well old boss more in a
            week or so. I may cable or I may post the fiver. Hope it comes in time for Xmas. Fondest
            love to you &amp; Clare &amp; the kidlets &amp; all the tribes. Will see you after the
            war alright. Tooraloo</p>

        <p>I hope you wont mind me the way I send you such spasmodic letters &amp; all that. You
            cant imagine how things get mixed here &amp; what arrangements we have &amp; their
            limitations. Still just a line to let you know <emote type = "positive">Im living and pretty healthy </emote>generally on
            it. I hope I can say the same in a week or so as we are expecting some scrap in a few
            days &amp; I think its going to be heavy at that. However well wait for it before we say
            any more. Im afraid Im very poor at sending you any description of these things but Ill
            tell you all about it when I come back. Hope everybody is quite well. Your last letter
            seemed to show you in a bit of a mix up. I was intending to send you a few quidlets as a
            Xmas cheerer but was unable to do so. Should you want a few quid let Lizzie know. Her
            last address was B.H. Shell always do anything possible for you too &amp; you know its
            your just dues. I think she can manage it alright for you &amp; I am writing her on the
            subject in case you find it necessary. Sorry old chapsies to hear of all the bad luck,
            but dont get downhearted. This will all end soon &amp; things will be alright. Wait till
            I come home. Youll be quite surprised the way things are going to go. So cheers. Hope
            dear old Clare is up to form again. And also all the kids &amp; Al &amp; Ted &amp; all
            the others. Tell them some day to expect a letter each, but I dont know when. <emote type = "negative">We are
            <factor type = "prep">continuously moving</factor> &amp; life is fairly strenuous</emote>. Our horses are getting What Ho but
            they are good stuff &amp; stand well. Now excuse this note &amp; dont think Im shelving
            any questions from your last letter. Fact is Ive come out here in such a hurry that I
            havent got any of the old letters here. Now heaps &amp; heaps of love to you all. Youll
            probably get this long after Xmas but lots of fun &amp; a happy New Year. </p>

        <p>It is quite a long time since I wrote you or received any from you. I think I wrote Clare
            after receiving her boshter cake &amp; I hope you got that alright. I never got Edes
            pudding &amp; whether it fell through the mail-bag or not is a matter of conjecture.
            Perhaps they thought by the weight it was a bomb or shell &amp; heaved it out of the
            mail. I believe the maximum weight allowed though is 11 lbs. Still hard luck. It may
            turn up yet &amp; I am living in hopes. Glad to see things are brightening again old
            cock. You are certainly having a very rough time of it. Everybody is but I think you are
            getting more than your share. However I am very pleased to see you are both as game as
            ever. Old pals I hope to be a bit of use when I got back &amp; whatever comes my way be
            sure you are the first for a "cut". Poor old Al &amp; Ted have been up against it a lot.
            I must write them today. Both Ede &amp; Nell seem very happy. I often get letters from
            Morgan now. Vera &amp; Win &amp; Nell all take a turn. Suppose all the kids are quite
            grown up now &amp; swanky. Would like to see them. Youve certainly got a crowd round
            you. How would a farm go? Youd have enough labor to work it. I often get letters from
            the firm &amp; think if you care about it I could work the oracle for you when I get
            back to get fixed up in something good. So keep battling &amp; save those quarter shares
            of [Tatts?]. Hope youve hooked some more ere this. </p>
        <p>We had our last battle in Palestine.<emote type = "positive"> Its a wonderful country</emote>, what we saw of it. And I
            would like a chance at getting land there. The horses had a good go in on wheat crops.
            We lost 4 officers. It makes one think a bit. However Ive got a good way of standing
            side on. My name went in for a decoration but dont know if it will come out. Some do
            &amp; some dont. I tried to transfer to the flying Corps but my Colonel wouldnt stand
            me. And he wont give me a rise so there you are. Still all good things come to those who
            wait. Got a letter from Aunt Molly w.a. &amp; Tommy in France some weeks ago. They both
            mentioned receiving letters from you. I have written them. Lizzie must be very
            downhearted. I get very few letters from her lately. 2 in seven weeks. I guess shes
            pretty miserable. Think this will end this year. We are doing much more than the papers
            say in the way of preparation. The Hit of the war will be about May &amp; it will finish
            one way or other then. Love to you both &amp; the kidlets. Keep up bravely as you have
            done, the road is sure to get easier directly</p>
