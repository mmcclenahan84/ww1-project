            <p>An employee at the Audit office added the following note at the top of the letter:
                Private H. Bullen, late of the Passengers dept, went through 11 months of
                Dardanelles campaign' Later moved to Malta, then to Egypt and Aden. Now encamped
                near Mount Sinai.</p>
            <opener><salute>Dear<name type="person"/>Percy</salute> ,</opener>
            <p>I am sorry I have been so long replying to your letter, but I have had my hands
                rather full just lately, so hope you will not mind. As I cannot get at my kit bag at
                present I shall only be able to write you a short letter because I have nearly run
                out of paper envelopes, so I shall have to make up for it next time.</p>
            <p>Well my dear Percy I am glad to know yourself and all at home are in the best of
                health and please convey to your father and mother my appreciation of their good
                wishes sent to me.</p>
            <p>I received your previous budget, but it arrived after I sent you the field postcard,
                my word it must take you a good time to write all those sheets of foolscap, but I
                delight in reading them, since being out here I find I cannot write an interesting
                letter. I am afraid my letters must often bore you, I have read your letter
                carefully and noted all the news about the office and some of our friends who are
                doing their share overseas, but the chief item you mention is poor old Rippington,
                it is the first time I have heard about him, poor old chap. I guess he was pleased
                to see you and I am sure it was an excellent idea of yours to send him some luxuries
                in the way of food with the proceeds of the money you collected for him at the
                office.</p>
            <p>I sincerely hope our friends out in France will come out of the terrible ordeal
                safely, I note that Bob Court and several others have gone and my brother has been
                out there some weeks now, also I have two cousins who have been out there some
                considerable time and been in the thick of the fighting, I hope the advance will
                mean the rounding up of the Huns and from the latest news received here everything
                seems to be going well at present, am looking forward to seeing the office soon.</p>
            <p>We are not having such an easy time as one would imagine, the heat is still very
                intense and the flies very troublesome and we have anything from an elephant to a
                cockroach creeping over our blankets at night time; the chameleon is our chief pet
                and will crawl over oneï¿½s body just like a tame mouse and the different colours they
                can change their body to suit the thing they settle on is wonderful.</p>
            <p>Now I must close Percy as you will see the paper is nearly filled up, so hope you
                will not mind this time, please remember me to all at home and all inquiring
                friends.</p>
