        <salute>Dear Percy,</salute>
    </opener>
    <p>
        <emote type="negative">I am sorry I have been so long replying to your letter, but I have
            had my hands rather full just lately, so hope you will not mind. As I cannot get at my
            kit bag at present I shall only be able to write you a short letter because I have
            nearly run out of paper envelopes, so I shall have to make up for it next time.</emote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <emote type="positive">Well my dear Percy I am glad to know yourself and all at home are in
            the best of health and please convey to your father and mother my appreciation of their
            good wishes sent to me.</emote>
    </p>
    <p>I received your previous budget, but it arrived after I sent you the field postcard, my word
        it must take you a good time to write all those sheets of foolscap, but <emote
            type="positive">I delight in reading them, since being out here I find I cannot write an
            interesting letter.</emote>
        <emote type="negative">I am afraid my letters must often bore you,</emote> I have read your
        letter carefully and noted all the news about the office and some of our friends who are
        doing their share overseas, but the chief item you mention is poor old Rippington, <emote
            type="negative">it is the first time I have heard about him, poor old chap.</emote> I
        guess he was pleased to see you and I am sure it was an excellent idea of yours to send him
        some luxuries in the way of food with the proceeds of the money you collected for him at the
        office.</p>
    <p>
        <emote type="positive">I sincerely hope our friends out in France will come out of the
            terrible ordeal safely, I note that Bob Court and several others have gone and my
            brother has been out there some weeks now, also I have two cousins who have been out
            there some considerable time and been in the thick of the fighting, I hope the advance
            will mean the rounding up of the Huns and from the latest news received here everything
            seems to be going well at present, am looking forward to seeing the office soon.</emote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <emote type="negative">We are not having such an easy time as one would imagine,<factor
                type="conditions">the heat is still very intense and the flies very troublesome and
                we have anything from an elephant to a cockroach creeping over our blankets at night
                time;</factor>
        </emote>
        <emote type="positive">the chameleon is our chief pet and will crawl over one's body just
            like a tame mouse and the different colours they can change their body to suit the thing
            they settle on is wonderful.</emote>
    </p>
    <p>Now I must close Percy as you will see the paper is nearly filled up, so hope you will not
        mind this time, please remember me to all at home and all inquiring friends.</p>

        <salute>With best wishes,</salute>
