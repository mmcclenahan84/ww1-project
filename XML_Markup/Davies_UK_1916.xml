            <p>Just a line to let you know I am getting on fine. I have been in France since Good
                Friday morning. Well it is not so bad, but of course not so comfortable as the
                office work.</p>
            <p>We had the Lord Mayor of London over to see us the other Sunday when we were resting,
                he made a little speech. How are all at the office? You might remember me to Mr
                Woodhams, Mr Jones and Mr Cowan and the boys also the girls. I suppose Mr Redford
                has retired by now.</p>
            <p>We have been in the trenches since the 13th and I expect we shall go out shortly. Our
                little dugout has just been flooded out, a very heavy thunderstorm, but we have run
                it out. It is rotten to see how the towns have been shelled to pieces. I don't
                suppose they will ever be rebuilt. My brother was home on leave some time ago that
                is the second time so he has not got off badly. He has been promoted to Sergeant
                now. He seems to be getting on fine.</p>
            <p>Have you seen Ernie Smith? How is he getting on, is he still in the A.P.C. (Army Pay
                Corps, non-fighting troops)? As I hear a lot have been transferred into line
                regiments.</p>
            <p>Well here's to the time when the war is all over and we are back in the same old
                place. The trenches where we were are only 25 to 30 yards from the Huns so had to
                keep a bit low.</p>
            <p>My address is 3343 Lance Corporal J. Davies, No. 1 Platoon D Company, 6th City of
                London Rifles, B.E.F., France. You might drop me a line to let me know how you are
                getting on and any news,</p>
