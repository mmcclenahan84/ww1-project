            <p>In our time spent with this material, we have become aware of a few factors that may have negatively impacted the nature of our data. 
                Firstly is an obvious point we came to early on in our research, which is the simple fact that these letters were being sent between 
                soldiers and thier families back home. Naturally, as to keep morale on the homefront high, it stands to reason that the content in these
                letters will not fully reflect the headspace a soldier finds himself in while in the trenches. Second, we became aware of rampant censorship 
                that most likely effected what could be included in these letters. It stands to reason that if a letter detailing the exact plans of a particular
                regiment fell into the wrong hands it would lead to a massacre. Additionally, if word of how horrible the conditions were in the trenches made it 
                back to the homefront, it would destroy public opinion of an already unpopular war. Lastly was a self imposed problem in our research, that being the
                language barrier we faced while assembling our corpus. Since we did not have any native French or German speakers on our team, we were naturally limited 
                in the number of letters we could draw on for our research. Now, we could have used translations of these works or our limited understanding of the afformentioned 
                languages to work through a few letters from France or Germany, but we felt that would leave out the neuances of the letters that would be lost in translation. 
                With this in mind, we were able to observe a notable change in both emotion and the wartime factors present within the letters over time. 
                This change is not only illustrated in the inverted bar charts on our Analysis page, but also in the below table.  </p>
