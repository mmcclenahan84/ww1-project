                <p class="content">Thank you for visisting our website! This website is the home to
                    the research project that we have done for our Digital Humanities class at the
                    University of Pittsburgh. This website will display the research that we
                    conducted regarding the mental and emotional health of WWI soldiers. As you
                    explore the site, keep in mind the research question that we are seeking to
                    answer:</p>

                <h2 class="content">Our research question: Which war-time factors contributed most
                    to the mental wellbeing of soldiers during WWI?</h2>
