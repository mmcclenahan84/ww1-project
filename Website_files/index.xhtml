                <p>Thank you for visisting our website! This website is the home to the research
                    project that we have done for our Digital Humanities class at the University of
                    Pittsburgh. This website will display the research that we conducted regarding
                    the mental and emotional health of WWI soldiers. As you explore the site, keep
                    in mind the research question that we are seeking to answer.</p>
                <h2>Our research question: Which war-time factors contributed most to the mental
                    wellbeing of soldiers during WWI?</h2>
