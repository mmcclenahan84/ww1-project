         <salute>Dear Mr Slater</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>Just a few lines to let you know how things are going with me, I have been going to write to
        before this, but on each occasion I have had to postpone it for some reason or other. I have
        been at this place since April. It is a fairly large city and has at one time been <emote type="positive">a very nice place</emote>, but it is now a heap of ruins, not a
        habitable house anywhere and no civilians, it is the nearest railhead to this part of the
        line and when we first came here things were pretty lively, but Fritz is gradually being
        pushed back here and has not troubled us for some time now I don't mind if he has forgotten
        we're here. Naldrett, Dawson and Anglesey and several other Audit chaps were up here a short
        time ago, but their detachment has now been moved to another part of the line, they are on
        the Light Railway and shift about more.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">It was nice to meet some of the old office pals again and I spent
            several pleasant hours with them while they were here</emote>, for I am the only G.W.
        man in this detachment. McMeeken is in the Railway Transport Officer's office about three
        miles from here and I see him occasionally. <emote type="negative">I was very sorry to hear
            of the deaths of Pond and Woodhams and no doubt there are other casualties amongst our
            office chaps but I seldom hear any office news. Our family has had to pay the penalty of
            war that so many thousands of families have done, for I am now the only one out here,
                <factor type="trauma">one brother has just been discharged after nine months in
                hospital</factor>, <factor type="battle">the second one was killed at Ypres about a
                month ago</factor> and <factor type="trauma">the third is now in a London hospital
                with a bad shrapnel wound in the thigh</factor>.</emote> I have had a variety of
        jobs, including navvy's work, carrying rails and sleepers, guard, point oiler and various
        other jobs. <emote type="positive">I am now a checker and number taker which job suits me
            much better, for it combines a lot of indoor clerical work with outdoor checking and now
            that we have to face another winter out here, it will be something to spend a little of
            my time indoors for I still have memories of last winter under canvas, but I shall not
            be so badly off this winter for <factor type="conditions">we are living in railway vans
                which will be much warmer</factor>. </emote>I have now been in France nearly nine
        months and <emote type="negative"> there does not appear to be any prospect of leave, for
            there are more here who have been eighteen months without leave and at the rate the
            R.O.D. men are going at present it will be well into next year before my turn
            comes.</emote>
      </p>
      <p> I understand that north London has suffered rather badly in the recent air raids but I hope
        you came through all right. My wife and family have had to get away from home, for it was
        upsetting their nerves and <emote type="positive">I am pleased to think that they are out of
            the danger zone. I am keeping fairly fit in health and always manage to keep cheery,
            which wants a bit of doing sometimes <factor type="conditions">especially now the muddy
                season has started</factor>, but let's hope this will be our last out here and by
            this time next year we may be all settling down to civilian life again.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>Please remember me to Mr Wood, Bert Hunt and all other Audit friends.</p>

         <salute>Dear Gertie,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p> I have written two or three times recently so you may get them together. <emote type="negative">We have been very busy for the last few weeks and have got through a
            great amount of work.</emote>
         <emote type="positive">We are much better off again as regards potatoes and other food
            stuffs for we have had a great quantity of stores.</emote> I fancy we shall be here for
        a time yet anyway it looks like it with such a quantity of stores aboard. You will see I am
        telling you the same things over and over again.<emote type="negative"> At least I know I
            have told you them once or twice but everything about is all of a sameness kind of
            thing.</emote>
         <factor type="sense">Ships here there and everywhere now.</factor> But soon we shall have a
        move that is when we can get through the White Sea. We shall have to look after all the
        shipping. <factor type="conditions">The snow is fast disappearing now.</factor> I came
        across an article in a paper the other day about this district and it said that 14 or 15
        years ago bears used to roam around hear [sic], but <factor type="sense">there seems to be
            nothing around now excepting the wild fowl, which are very numorous.</factor> I believe
        salmon are numerous at certain times of the year. The 2nd and 3rd of May we had a <emote type="negative">terrific</emote>
         <factor type="conditions">snow blizzard.</factor> We should have left the ship to go away
        and do some work on another ship but <emote type="negative">we could not get away from our
            ship <factor type="conditions">it was so rough</factor>
         </emote>. <factor type="sense">
            We have no night now, the sun goes down but it never goes dark, it is eternally
            daylight.</factor> Of course I told you we have had an entire change round and I have a
        new job now, part of the ship. <emote type="positive">I have not half the time I used to
            have but I enjoy the robust work much better and I get to see much more with working
            away.</emote> We get up at 6.30 and work until 1.00 so we put a few hours in don't we.
        That is when we are working away. Did you get the £1-0-0 I remitted? Let me know. I have
        remitted another £3-0-0 this month. Let me know if you receive this also. I shall probably
        send a little more next month or later. Don't hold the paper money. Bank it or keep it by
        you in gold until I come home. Tell Dad I shall to him as soon as I can get enough to tell
        him about. Give my best love to everyone at home, I often think about you all.</p>

         <salute>Dear Bertie,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>Just a few lines to let you know how we are getting on out here, I forgot when I last wrote
        you last and what news I told you. We marched down from the hills, 9,000 feet up in the
        Himalaya Mountains last October to Rawalpindi, then shortly afterwards out to camp returning
        just before Xmas. In February I obtained a furlough and <emote type="positive"> had a fine
            tour of places of interest, down to Delhi then right across India to Calcutta, had
            several letters of introduction from brother Freemasons to awfully nice people there and
            had a most enjoyable time, spent a few days at Agra on the return journey, travelled
            roughly just over 3,000 miles with several nights in the train.</emote> A few days after
        returning the regiment was <factor type="prep">placed under orders to march 83 miles to
            Noushera on the frontier border</factor>, where over 10,000 British and native troops
        were concentrated, a similar number at Peshawar farther down the frontier, in readiness for
        threatened trouble with the Afghans, whom German intriguers had been amongst. <emote type="negative">Noushera was a cruel place, nothing but a dust heap at the foot of the
            mountain.</emote>
         <factor type="prep">We spent several weeks there, training in mountain warfare</factor>,
            <emote type="negative">my word, it was chronic, <factor type="conditions">the terrific
                heat</factor> and the awful climbing for miles day after day, with all transport on
            mules and camels through the rocky mountain passes.</emote> At one bivouac we
        encountered <factor type="conditions">bad water</factor>, and about <factor type="trauma">forty of our fellows went down with enteric fever [typhoid]</factor>. One died, but the
        others pulled through as they had been inoculated; <emote type="positive">a wonderful thing
            inoculation has proved to be in India.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">Well in spite of the hard time, we returned to Rawalpindi in fine
            condition</emote> after the Afghan trouble had subsided for the time being, it is always
        liable to break out at any moment and we are always in readiness to move at any time.</p>
      <p>Then we changed to another barracks in Rawalpindi in April, and have been stationed on the
        plains all the summer. <emote type="negative">
            <factor type="conditions">The heat has been intense</factor>; one never goes outside
            after 10am; after tiffin at 1 o'clock the barracks and in fact everywhere is dead to the
            world until between 5 and 6pm</emote>, when sports such as tennis, cricket hockey and
        swimming at the baths are possible.</p>
      <p>
         <factor type="conditions">Every soldier has a punkah (fan) swinging over his bed all night
            and during the hours off duty during the day. Many men sleep out on the barrack square
            on their beds at night. During the past few weeks the monsoon has been on, with
            torrential rain which I would fail to describe.</factor>
         <emote type="negative">Now the intense heat of the sun is draining the moisture out of the
            earth with the result that it is like living in the moist fern house at Kew
            Gardens,</emote>
         <emote type="negative">only worse</emote>, <factor type="trauma">and many men are being
            bowled over with fever</factor>. <emote type="positive">Ever since arriving at India,
            getting on for two years ago, I have been as fit as a fiddle and enjoyed exceptional
            health</emote>, <emote type="negative">until a fortnight ago, when I was suddenly taken
            ill with <factor type="trauma">sandfly fever, a most painful, lowering form of fever,
            </factor> and was carried to hospital and also found to be suffering from <factor type="trauma">pleurisy</factor>
         </emote>. I was in bed several days subsisting on a
        small quantity of milk with the result that when I was allowed to get up I was too weak to
        stand. <emote type="positive">I was discharged after ten days and am getting on quite
            alright now, and am leaving on next furlough to a hill station in the Himalayas shortly
            to recuperate</emote>. In November we are on the move again, <factor type="prep">marching about 80 miles to a big camp, for manoeuvres of several weeks,</factor>
        returning again just before Christmas.<emote type="negative"> But marching eighty miles in
            five days under an Indian sun is very different to cloudy England.</emote> Every
        regiment in India, both regular and territorial, is being heavily reinforced by drafts from
        England. We have had three drafts one consisting of nearly 300 men, then another of 67, now
        another of 84, bringing us up to nearly 1,100 men. There are thousands of British troops,
        mostly Terriers (members of the Territorial army) (there are only eight regular infantry
        regiments left in India) stationed at various frontier places, and all sorts of rumours
        prevalent about a big expedition moving during the next few months, all possible
        preparations are being made for it, well, if the Indian govt. <emote type="negative">make as
            disastrous a muddle of it when the fighting does come off as they made over the
            Mesopotamia campaign, then with foes like the ferocious Afghans there will be a terrible
            price to pay in life, for the country and the <factor type="conditions">terrific
                heat</factor> will be enough without having to fight every inch of the
        way.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">I had a very interesting letter from Mr Wood some time ago which I
            answered recently, also had one from Mr Price a few days ago.</emote> I can quite
        picture the changes which must have occurred in the staff of the Audit since I left. Of
        course you are over the age limit, so have not been called upon. <emote type="negative">I
            expect if, and when, I do return safely that life in England will seem very different
            under the altered conditions. I shall be glad to get home again and only wish I could
            see a prospect of doing so, with the conclusion of this terrible war.</emote>
         <emote type="positive">I have had a very enjoyable time in India</emote>
         <emote type="negative">(apart from soldiering which I always did enjoy, although I think I
            have had sufficient now)</emote> having made the acquaintance of awfully nice residents
        in 'Pindi, and by virtue of rank, being allowed the privilege of wearing mufti makes it so
        much more comfortable when going out of barracks than being in a tight uniform in the
        climate.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">I hear regularly from my wife and little one every week. Am
            glad to say they are well.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>Please convey my kind regards to all those left in the office
            that I know. Trusting you are all fit and well and that we shall meet again before many
            more months elapse.

         <emote type="positive">Many thanks for your long and interesting letter, which has now
            reached me, I will to it at length at a more opportune moment.</emote>
      </p>
      <p> As you will see by above address I have left India. The regiment left the N.W. Indian
        frontier in January where <factor type="conditions">the winter had been bitterly
            cold</factor> and embarked at Karachi after a three day's train journey, <emote type="positive">then six day's most pleasant voyage to Aden where we landed and now join
            part of the Aden Field Force.</emote> I have been stationed with a strong detachment on
        the desert in close proximity to a Turkish force <factor type="battle">who frequently
            shelled us</factor>, but without any material damage. <emote type="neutral">The heat
            after the cold winter in India is very trying, <factor type="conditions">scorching hot
                sun, endless sand and myriads of torturing flies.</factor>
         </emote> Life is very
        different here as compared to India. I never pictured myself riding across the Arabian
        dessert on a camel. <emote type="positive">Am pleased to say I am splendidly fit and well,
            but should be glad when the struggle is over and hope I shall be amongst those who
            return home safely.</emote>

         <salute>My dear Miss Jamieson</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>Doubtless you have heard that I <factor type="battle">got plugged</factor> some time ago and
        as a consequence have <factor type="trauma">been in Hosp for the last 9 weeks or
            more</factor>, and am now being invalided back to Australia for 6 months, so <emote type="positive">I may have a chance of seeing you</emote>, if I have to go to Brisbane
        on arrival. <factor type="battle"> The whole trouble rose through getting in the road of a
            Bosch high-explosive shell, which practically burst amongst 6 of us, killing one Officer
            (an Artillery chap) and wounding the other 5 of us.</factor>
         <factor type="trauma">I unfortunately stopped 4 pieces of the ironmongery (2 in the knee,
            and 2 lower down) made rather a mess of the knee for a while, but it is getting on
            pretty well now &amp; although I cant put much weight on it, I can get about fairly well
            on the patent crutches they gave me here.</factor> One Dr reckoned it would take 6
        months to get right &amp; the other doesnt think it ever be much good, but I think he's
        wrong, anyhow instead of hanging about here for 6 months, they are sending me to Sunny
        Australia for the same period &amp; to see if the leg will get better. <emote type="negative">I had no idea it was going to take so long and was very disappointed at
            having to give up my old Battalion which was doing so well after having practically
            selected its personnel &amp; officers and been with it for 18 months. I tell you it
            hurts to give up the old Unit, and had it over to someone else</emote> probably for
        good.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">Do you remember Major Heron of the 42nd (used to be Capt Heron when
            they left Queensland) well he took over the 41st when I left it, and as far as I know
            still has command, with Major Sheridan as second in command. Your favourite (Capt
            French) was still going strong when I left and was in command of C Coy. He is still a
            great ladykiller(?) in fact he had the chance of 10 days leave to Paris just before I
            went there, but wouldnt take it, but he was keen on getting leave to England.. Hastings
            I guess, eh? By jove Paris was great, it is some" place, I can tell you, and dont the
            women dress, it isnt so much what they put on, but the way they wear it. It is by a long
            way the prettiest City I've seen &amp; I dont think London can hold a candle to it.
            London may be larger but I dont think it is nearly so pretty.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>Well how is your Patriotic work getting on these days? I suppose you are as busy as ever, and
        as hard worked as ever in the interests of The Boys. Really you girls deserve the D.S.O. for
        all your splendid services. <emote type="positive">Do you know that the first suit of
            pyjamas I put on when I got into this Hosp was labelled from the Brisbane Courier Fund
            funny isnt it? It shows how far reaching are the results of various Colonial
            efforts.</emote> Well Im off to bed now, will probably be leaving for Australia in a day
        or two.Kindest regards to Mollie &amp; yourself. Hoping to see you later on U boats
        permitting.</p>

         <salute>Dear Percy,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>
         <emote type="negative">I am sorry I have been so long replying to your letter, but I have
            had my hands rather full just lately, so hope you will not mind. As I cannot get at my
            kit bag at present I shall only be able to write you a short letter because I have
            nearly run out of paper envelopes, so I shall have to make up for it next time.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">Well my dear Percy I am glad to know yourself and all at home are in
            the best of health and please convey to your father and mother my appreciation of their
            good wishes sent to me.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>I received your previous budget, but it arrived after I sent you the field postcard, my word
        it must take you a good time to write all those sheets of foolscap, but <emote type="positive">I delight in reading them, since being out here I find I cannot write an
            interesting letter.</emote>
         <emote type="negative">I am afraid my letters must often bore you,</emote> I have read your
        letter carefully and noted all the news about the office and some of our friends who are
        doing their share overseas, but the chief item you mention is poor old Rippington, <emote type="negative">it is the first time I have heard about him, poor old chap.</emote> I
        guess he was pleased to see you and I am sure it was an excellent idea of yours to send him
        some luxuries in the way of food with the proceeds of the money you collected for him at the
        office.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">I sincerely hope our friends out in France will come out of the
            terrible ordeal safely, I note that Bob Court and several others have gone and my
            brother has been out there some weeks now, also I have two cousins who have been out
            there some considerable time and been in the thick of the fighting, I hope the advance
            will mean the rounding up of the Huns and from the latest news received here everything
            seems to be going well at present, am looking forward to seeing the office soon.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="negative">We are not having such an easy time as one would imagine,<factor type="conditions">the heat is still very intense and the flies very troublesome and
                we have anything from an elephant to a cockroach creeping over our blankets at night
                time;</factor>
         </emote>
         <emote type="positive">the chameleon is our chief pet and will crawl over one's body just
            like a tame mouse and the different colours they can change their body to suit the thing
            they settle on is wonderful.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>Now I must close Percy as you will see the paper is nearly filled up, so hope you will not
        mind this time, please remember me to all at home and all inquiring friends.</p>

         <salute>Dear Mr Welsh,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>A lot has happened since I last wrote to you and <factor type="prep">we have moved, and
            moved, and moved again, and still we are moving. There is nothing at all to say about
            the actual coming off. We were told to pack up, and having done so, were marched off and
            oon afterwards were making up a four for Bridge in quite a comfortable cabin and
            enjoying the unwanted luxury of electric light</factor>.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="neutral">The only thing that struck one in coming away was that nothing had
            altered and it might easily have been the night I landed. The same old beach apparently
            full up with boxes of bully beef, tinned milk and jam, <factor type="battle">the same
                old destroyer, with its search light playing on the shore, keeping up its systematic
                bombardment and the same old swish of bullets around and dropping into the
                water.</factor>
         </emote>
         <factor type="prep">No sooner was Christmas here than we were packing up again, to come on
            here.</factor> A large town a few miles on the interior, <emote type="negative">
            <factor type="sense">it is a filthy rotten smelly hole</factor> and we always carried loaded
            revolvers and walked about in batches and were never out after dark. Probably the people
            are not ill disposed to us but some of them looked pretty villainous and it was better
            to be on the safe side</emote>.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">We have had quite a good time and the regular hours and regular meals
            have backed everyone up well and now we are all as fit as ever apparently.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks very much for the Xmas card <emote type="negative">it was a bit late but then all our
            Xmas letters and parcels were on account of the way we have been moving about; we lost a
            good mail, too, on the Persia (S.S. Persia, which was torpedoed and sunk in December
            1915).</emote> I am enclosing a few photos that might be of interest to you. I have some
        more snaps coming later on and will let you have some if they turn out to be any good. With

         <emote type="positive">Just a line to let you know I am getting on fine. I have been in
            France since Good Friday morning. Well it is not so bad, but of course not so
            comfortable as the office work.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>We had the Lord Mayor of London over to see us the other Sunday when we were resting, he made
        a little speech.</p>
      <p>How are all at the office? You might remember me to Mr Woodhams, Mr Jones and Mr Cowan and
        the boys also the girls. I suppose Mr Redford has retired by now.</p>
      <p>We have been in the trenches since the 13th and I expect we shall go out shortly. <factor type="conditions">Our little dugout has just been flooded out, a very heavy
            thunderstorm, but we have run it out.</factor>
         <emote type="negative">It is rotten to see
            how the towns have been shelled to pieces. I don't suppose they will ever be
            rebuilt.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="negative">My brother was home on leave some time ago that is the second time so
            he has not got off badly. He has been promoted to Sergeant now. He seems to be getting
            on fine</emote>.</p>
      <p>Have you seen Ernie Smith? How is he getting on, is he still in the A.P.C. (Army Pay Corps,
        non-fighting troops)? As I hear a lot have been transferred into line regiments.</p>
      <p>Well here's to the time when the war is all over and we are back in the same old place.
            <factor type="battle">The trenches where we were are only 25 to 30 yards from the Huns
            so had to keep a bit low.</factor>

      </opener>
      <p>How are things going with you now? I expect like the rest of us will be glad when the better
        weather sets in for there is no doubt about it, <factor type="conditions">it has been rough
            lately.</factor>
      </p>
      <p>Since I last wrote to you<factor type="prep"> we have shifted to another part of the
            line</factor>
         <factor type="battle">and it is a warm shop, for both sides must have all
            guns they can find and it is nothing but one long duel all day and every day but thank
            goodness it gives over a bit a night so that one can get on with their work. You see of
            a night the flashes of the guns can be seen so plainly that is why they do not fire a
            lot then.</factor>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="negative">Just on our right our people retook some trenches we had lost, oh what
            a rough time the poor devils had, <factor type="conditions">snow and mud as much as you
                like</factor> and they had to lay in it for two days and grub could not be got to
            them.</emote> I expect there have been a few more from Paddington called up by now, it
        seems if the authorities mean to have all the men they want and if they can't get them one
        way they will another, and it certainly looks as if they will be wanted for out here. <emote type="negative">One cannot see any signs of an early settlement.</emote> I see by the
        papers that the air raids have been busy in England again. I suppose you have not seen
        anything of them yet, has Rory Moore had any more frights? <emote type="negative"> We have
            the taubes [German aircraft] over our hospital nearly every day or night and I can tell
            you we got some starts at times.</emote>
         <factor type="battle">The nearest we have to
            them since I have been here is just one yard from the main door, at 12.30 it blew in two
            pairs of double doors and shattered on end of the building to bits but not a great deal
            of damage to life which after all is the main thing.</factor> The arrangements we in
        work is five or six days up the line and four or five down if you are lucky. <emote type="negative">Of course at times these arrangements go to pot when there is an attack
            and we get a warm time and I should like to enlarge on these things but of course you
            understand I cannot.</emote>

         <emote type="negative">The worst has happened.</emote> The War Office has sent us down to
        this place which is miles from nowhere. The camp however is made up of hundreds of huts is
        according to the 'old uns' at the game the finest they have ever been in, <emote type="positive">certainly everything is alright</emote> but <factor type="conditions">
            the place is so muddy and my time is split up. One half getting frightfully dirty and
            the other getting myself clean again.</factor>
         <emote type="positive">However it's all in the game and can't be helped.</emote>
         <factor type="conditions">There are twenty to a hut. The beds are three long boards on two
            trestles about eight or nine inches off the floor, a straw mattress and a straw pillow,
            and four blankets. Not a bit what I have been used to.</factor>
         <emote type="positive">However I am now quite comfortable in it and sleep like a top.
            Marvellous how you think we settle down to it. Don't you think?</emote>
         <factor type="prep">We rise at 6.30am. Breakfast (porridge and bacon) at 7.30. Parade at
            8.20. Drill till 10.30. Then half an hour's rest. Then more drill up to 12.30. Dinner at
            1 o'clock (meat and two vegetables and sweets). Parade again at 2.20. Then more drill
            which brings us up to 4pm. We are then dismissed for the day. Tea at 5pm (bread, butter
            and jam). After which we can do what we like until 9.15. By this time we have to be in
            our huts for the final day's roll call and at 10pm. All lights have to be out. That's
            what my day consists of at present.</factor>
         <emote type="neutral">It may not seem much, and really it isn't, but I am half the day
            cleaning up.</emote> The grub is alright but there is not quite enough of it at present.
            <emote type="positive">I think however this will be right as soon as they have made all
            necessary arrangements.</emote>
         <factor type="sense">For the time being the Non-Commissioned Officers seem to be a little
            overworked.</factor>
         <factor type="prep">This is the same every day, varied on two mornings a week with a long
            route march in the morning. Of course we only have half a day on Saturday and only a
            Church parade on Sunday.</factor>
         <emote type="positive">So altogether things are not so bad.</emote>
         <emote type="negative">The only thing is I can't get away for weekends, as it would take up
            most of the time to travel to London and back.</emote> I shall try however and run up to
        town in a few weeks' time if possible.Kind regards to all at 'Omega', and everybody at 164,

         <salute>Dear Mr Hunt,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>I expect you have heard at the office about me being in England <factor type="trauma">suffering from gas poisoning,</factor> and as it is quite a long time since I last
        wrote to you, no doubt a few lines will be acceptable, to explain matters.</p>
      <p>
         <factor type="prep">We left the trenches at Vimy Ridge on July 5th, and marching back about
            14 miles we eventually reached a village named Ostreville for the purpose of having a
            divisional rest. The signallers thought an orchard would be very convenient to erect
            bivouacs in, so when we were busy carrying out this idea an old Frenchman appeared at
            the scene, and raised objections. However he agreed at last to allow us in at one end of
            the orchard, thinking, I suppose, that we would wander about his place!</factor>
         <emote type="positive">We had an enjoyable time here for six days,</emote> and then <factor type="prep">had to return to our old billets near Mount St. Eloi until the whole of the
            division had retired. We guessed by this move that our 'rest' was over, and the
            following days were spent in marching, and travelling by motor lorries and train until
            we arrived at Mericourt Station on July 21st near Albert</factor>.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">After a delightful swim in <factor type="conditions">the river near
                the billet</factor>
         </emote>
         <factor type="prep">we marched off the following night,
            to take part in the 'big push.'</factor>
         <factor type="conditions">We slept in an open
            field that night near Fricourt farm, and were rather rudely awakened by a few German
            shells landing near us.</factor>
      </p>
      <p>For five days we were lying in reserve in this district, and occupied our time in watching an
        army of men at work in the valley, making roads, railways, boring for water and laying down
        water pipes, also practicing attacks in the old trenches. <emote type="positive"> It was
            very interesting to see the great amount of artillery, busy practically all day and
            night,</emote> and to read their messages sent by visual signalling [often using lights]
        from a ridge across the valley. </p>
      <p>
         <factor type="prep">Our period in reserve being up, we moved to Mametz Wood to lie there in
            support for five days, before going into the trenches at High Wood.</factor>
         <factor type="battle"> On arrival at the edge of the wood at night, we were welcomed by a
            big dose of gas shells and shrapnel, which was applied steadily throughout the night by
            the German artillery. </factor>
         <factor type="trauma">Having to assist in putting our
            signalling gear into a hole for safety, I was prevented from using my respirator for the
            first quarter of an hour, as we could not see on account of the darkness and dust made
            by the ammunition columns rushing along the road, and it was during this time that I
            must have breathed in enough gas to put me out of action.</factor>
         <factor type="prep">Afterwards of course respirators were used, when we were settled in
            holes by the roadside for the night.</factor>
      </p>
      <p>I remained with the battalion until I was sent to the casualty clearing station on August 3rd
        and reached Rouen hospital the next day. I had to wait until the 9th and crossed the channel
        from Havre to Southampton on the New Zealand ship Marama, with about 800 other patients, the
        day after. <emote type="positive">It was a splendid boat with every convenience for carrying
            wounded men, and the sisters and orderlies were colonials.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>It was last Friday week when I arrived here, and must say <emote type="positive">it is very
            comfortable and quiet. I had to remain in bed until last Saturday, but of course I
            cannot do any route marching yet! So I have to take life quietly, which is no hardship I
            can assure you after France.</emote> I am on an ordinary diet, and taking medicine.</p>
      <p>I hear you have Mr Symons back again, is that so? And is he back in the same old spot?<emote type="neutral"> I hope he is pretty fit, although I suppose there must be something
            wrong with him, to be back again.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>I suppose things are as quiet as usual with you. Have you had your holidays yet? This is
        about your time I believe. I shall be glad of a few lines when you have time, to hear the
        latest about the office.I hope you are keeping fit, also Mr J.B. Taylor and Mr Woodhams and
        with kind regards to you all.</p>

      <p>
         <emote type="positive">Many thanks for your most welcome and interesting letter safely
            received, and I am pleased to hear of the latest news about friends at the office and
            others in different parts of the world.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="negative">I have not had a line from H. Martin for many months</emote>, <emote type="positive">but I hear he has had leave recently, and no doubt he gave you a call. I
            hoped to have had that pleasure before this time, but I expect to be seeing you one of
            these fine days.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="neutral">I am still a patient in hospital, and although at times the life is
            monotonous in this quiet place, it is preferable to France so I won't grumble.</emote>
         <factor type="conditions">The weather has been so rough and wild of late, that a lot our
            time is spent by the fireside,</factor> and <emote type="positive">many pleasant hours
            are passed in comparing notes with men who are patients from minesweepers.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>We have had different men from this branch of the Navy for several weeks, and at present five
        are in my ward. <factor type="trauma">Two of these are survivors from a minesweeper that was
            blown up by a German mine nearly a fortnight ago, just outside Dartmouth Castle. </factor>
         <factor type="prep">They are still clearing the sea outside here and the boats return to
            anchor in the river at night,</factor> and the pals of these men visit them this
        evening. <emote type="positive">The officers are also very good in calling and leaving gifts
            and the wounded Tommies share in the fruits thereof!</emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="negative">I have heard from Scotland that <factor type="battle">the 8th Argylls
                suffered heavily a short time ago in France</factor>, and in the newspapers today I
            notice the names of nine officers who I knew in France, including the Captain of my
            company who is killed. I don't know if the 6th Seaforths, who are in the same brigade,
            were in action at the same time, but I shouldn't be surprised, anyhow I hope [Gilbert]
            Williams came through safely if he was there.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>I am enclosing two privilege forms, and will be glad if you will get them signed and
        returned. <emote type="positive ">I have had some nice afternoons at Torquay and Paignton
            and was <factor type="conditions">there during the rough weather a short time ago, when
                the Brixham trawler was wrecked and sea was so rough.</factor>
         </emote> I hope this

      <info> This transcript is from a letter by Private Leonard Hart to his parents on 19 October
        1917. Hart describes in detail the terrible events of 12 October 1917 when New Zealand
        troops were asked to take the Bellvue Spur, near Passchendaele. Historian Jock Phillip
        writes, 'this distressing, but accurate, description of the battle ... is a remarkable piece
        of writing, particularly given Hart's lack of formal education.' The transcript is from Jock

         <salute>Dear Mother, Father and Connie,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>In a postcard which I sent you about a fortnight ago, I mentioned that we were on the eve of
        a great event, and that I had no time to write you a long letter. <emote type="positive">Well that great event is over now, and by some strange act of fortune I have once again
            come through without a scratch</emote>.</p>
      <p>
         <factor type="battle">The great event mentioned consisted of a desperate attack by our
            Division against a ridge, strongly fortified and strongly held by the Germans, but the
            name of which I had better not mention.</factor>
         <emote type="negative">For the first time in our brief history as an army the New Zealanders
            failed in their objective with the most appalling slaughter I have ever seen.</emote> My
        Company went into action 180 strong and we came out thirty-two strong. <emote type="neutral">Still, we have nothing to be ashamed of as our commander afterwards told us that no
            troops in the world could possibly have taken the position</emote>, <emote type="negative">but this is small comfort when one remembers the hundreds of lives that
            have been lost and nothing gained.</emote>I will give you an account of the battle as
        near as I can without meaning any names or exasperating the censor (should he happen to open
        this) too much.</p>
      <p>
         <factor type="battle">On a certain Wednesday evening our Brigade received orders to proceed
            to the firing line and relieve a Brigade of Tommies who had two nights previously
            advanced their positions a distance of two thousand yards and had held the captured
            ground against several counter attacks by the Huns.</factor>
         <emote type="negative">These Tommies had, however, failed to take their last objective and
            we knew before we left that we were going to be put over the top to try and take
            it.</emote> At dusk we started off from <factor type="conditions">the town where we had
            been billeted for a few days, in full fighting order, to proceed to the front
            line.</factor> Our track led over five miles of newly conquered ground without lines of
        communication, roads, or anything but shell holes half full of water. The weather had for
        some days been wet and cold and the mud was in places up to the knees. <emote type="negative">We struggled on through this sea of mud for some hours, and everyone was
            feeling pretty well done.</emote> It was quite common for a man to get stuck in the mud
        and have to get three or four to drag him out. <emote type="negative">You can have no idea
            of the utter desolation caused by modern shell fire.</emote> The ground we were
        traversing had all been deluged with our shells before being taken from the Germans, <factor type="conditions">and for those five miles leading to our front line trench there was
            nothing but utter desolation, not a blade of grass, or tree, here and there a heap of
            bricks marking where a village or farmhouse had once stood, numerous ‘tanks’ stuck in
            the mud, and for the rest, just one shell hole touching another.</factor>
      </p>
      <p>
         <factor type="conditions">The torn up condition of the ground made the mud ten times worse
            than it would otherwise have been. The only structures which had stood the bombardment
            in any way at all were the German machine gun emplacements.</factor>
         <emote type="positive">These emplacements are marvellous structures made of concrete with
            walls often ten feet thick and the concrete reinforced throughout with railway irons and
            steel bands and bars. There is room inside them for a large number of men but of course
            they vary in size.</emote> Many of these emplacements had been shattered to pieces in
        spite of their strength but others had withstood the bombardment. The ground was strewn with
        the corpses of numerous Huns and Tommies. Dead horse and mules lay everywhere, yet no
        attempt had been made to bury any of them. Well, we at length arrived at our destination –
        the front line and relieved the worn out Tommies. <emote type="negative"> They had not
            attempted to dig trenches but had simply held the line by occupying a long line of shell
            holes, two or three men to each hole.</emote>
         <factor type="trauma"> Many of them seemed
            too worn out to walk properly and I don’t know how some of them must have got on during
            their long tramp through the mud back to billets.</factor>
      </p>
      <p>
         <factor type="prep">Each of us had a shovel with him, so we set to work to make some kind of
            trenches.</factor> We were at this point about half way up one slope of the ridge which
        in the course of fortyeight hours we were to try and take. <emote type="positive">The mud
            was not so bad here owing to the water being able to run away into a swamp at the foot
            of the ridge.</emote>
         <factor type="prep">Anyway by daybreak we had dug ourselves in sufficiently and, although
            wet and covered in mud from head to foot, we felt fit for a feed of bread and bully
            beef, for breakfast. We stayed in our new trenches all that day and the day following
            during which it rained off and on, and Fritz kept things lively with his
            artillery.</factor>
         <factor type="battle">At 3 o’clock on the third morning we received orders to attack the
            ridge at half past five, which was just before daylight. We were accordingly arranged in
            three successive waves or lines; each wave about fifty yards ahead of the
            other.</factor>
         <factor type="conditions"> There was a certain amount of difficulty in this operation as it
            was pitch dark and raining heavily.</factor> When all was ready we were told to lay down
        and wait the order to charge. <emote type="negative">My Company was in the first wave of the
            attack which partly accounted for our heavy casualties.</emote> Our artillery barrage
        (curtain of fire) was to open out at twenty past five and play on the German positions on
        top of the ridge 150 yards ahead of us. It was to move forward fifty yards in every four
        minutes – that is to say we were to advance as our barrage advanced and keep 100 to 150
        yards behind it.</p>
      <p>
         <factor type="battle">At twenty past five to the second, and with a roar that shook the
            ground, some three thousand of our guns opened out on the five mile sector of the
            advance. (The whole advance was on a five mile front and our Brigade occupied about a
            thousand yards of this front forming the centre of the advance. Our Rifle Brigade was on
            our left and a Tommy Division on the left of them again.</factor> An Australian Division
        was on our right and another Tommy Division on the right of them again.) Through some
        blunder our artillery barrage opened up about two hundred yards short of the specified range
        and thus opened right in the midst of us. <emote type="negative"> It was a truly awful time
            – our own men getting cut to pieces in dozens by our own guns. Immediate disorganisation
            followed.</emote>
         <factor type="battle">I heard an officer shout an order to the men to retire a short
            distance and wait for our barrage to lift. Some, who heard the order, did so. Others,
            not knowing what to do under the circumstances, stayed where they were, while others
            advanced towards the German positions, only to be mown down by his deadly rifle and
            machine gun fire.</factor>
      </p>
      <p>
         <factor type="battle">At length our barrage lifted and we all once more formed up and made a
            rush for the ridge.</factor>
         <emote type="negative"> What was our dismay upon reaching almost to the top of the ridge to
            find a long line of practically undamaged German concrete machine gun emplacements with
            barbed wire entanglements in front of them fully fifty yards deep.</emote> The wire had
        been cut in a few places by our artillery but only sufficient to allow a few men through it
        at a time. <emote type="negative"> Even then what was left of us made an attempt to get
            through the wire and a few actually penetrated as far as his emplacements only to be
            shot down as fast as they appeared. Dozens got hung up in the wire and shot down before
            their surviving comrades’ eyes. It was now broad daylight and what was left of us
            realised that the day was lost.</emote> We accordingly lay down in shell holes or any
        cover we could get and waited. Any man who showed his head was immediately shot. <emote type="neutral">They were maravellous shots those Huns.</emote> We had lost nearly eighty
        per cent of our strength and gained about 300 yards of ground in the attempt. This 300 yards
        was useless to us for the Germans still held and dominated the ridge. We hung on all that
        day and night. There was no one to give us orders, all our officers of the Battalion having
        been killed or wounded with the exception of three, and these were all Second Lieutenants
        who could not give a definite order about the position without authority. All my Company
        officers were killed outright one of them the son of the Reverend Ryburn of Invercargill,
        was shot dead beside me. </p>
      <p>The second day after <emote type="negative">this tragic business</emote>, we were surprised
        to see about half a dozen Huns suddenly appear waving a white flag. They proved to be red
        cross men and the flag was a sign that they were asking for a truce to take in their wounded
        and bury their dead. It was granted and not a shot was fired on either side during the whole
        of that afternoon. <emote type="positive">It was a humane and gallant act and one worthy of
            such gallant defenders as those particular Huns certainly were.</emote> Our stretcher
        bearers were able to go and take all our wounded from the barbed wire, a thing that would
        have been impossible otherwise. <factor type="prep">Numbers of us who at ordinary times had
            nothing to do with stretcher bearing were put on and we had all the wounded carried out
            before nightfall. We had no time to bury many of our dead but the wounded should be the
            only consideration at times like that.</factor> I went out and buried poor Ryburn. He
        came with the Main Body, but had not been in France long. <emote type="neutral">The
            proportion of killed to wounded was exceptionally high compared to other battles, owing
            to the perfect marksmanship of the German machine gunners and snipers.</emote>
         <emote type="negative">My Company has come out with no officers, only one Sergeant out of
            seven, one Corporal and thirty men. Even then we are not the worst off.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <factor type="prep">T he third night after the advance we were relieved and taken back about
            three miles behind the line. Here we acted as a reserve to the Battalion which had taken
            over our sector for two days, and we were finally taken right out to billets well behind
            the line where we are now recuperating.</factor> The night we came out here I received a
        parcel from you. The note inside was dated 10/7/17, and I can tell you that I felt hungry
        enough to eat note and all. I received another parcel from you about three days before we
        shifted to this front which would be about three weeks ago. They were appreciated about as
        well as it is possible to appreciate anything, I can assure you. Your letters of Mamma’s
        25/7/17, Connie’s of same date and Dad’s of 7/7/17 arrived about a week before the affair of
        the ridge. <factor type="trauma">A number of our chaps who came through have since been sent
            to hospital chiefly with trench feet due to standing in cold mud for long hours. I have
            a touch of them myself but they are not bad enough to be sent away with.</factor> I have
        just decided to have this letter posted by someone going on leave to England, so I will tell
        you a few more facts which it would not have been advisable to mention otherwise.......</p>
      <p>Fighting of a very successful nature had been going on around Ypres for some months previous
        to our late set back at the ridge where the British are now held up. I hear that another
        attempt is to be made to take it, but it will not be with our Division. The name of this
        famous ridge is Passchendaele Ridge, and it has defied two attempts to take it already – viz
        the one attempted by the Tommies whom we relieved and our own......</p>
      <p>The results of our stunt you now know so no more need be said about it except that we did as
        well or even better that some of the Divisions on our right and left. None of them took
        their objectives and I know for a fact that our Third Brigade’s losses and those of the
        Australians were every bit as heavy as ours. The Second Brigade has at least the
        satisfaction of knowing that they held a few hundred yards of ground they took, <emote type="neutral"> and our commander has since told us that no troops in the world could
            possibly have taken the ridge under similar circumstances. </emote>
         <emote type="negative"> Some ‘terrible blunder’ has been made. Someone is responsible for
            that barbed wire not having been broken up by our artillery. Someone is responsible for
            the opening of our barrage in the midst of us instead of 150 yards ahead of us. Someone
            else is responsible for those machine gun emplacements being left practically intact,
            but the papers will all report another glorious success, and no one except those who
            actually took part in it will know any different.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion I will relate to you another little incident or two which never reaches the
        press, or if it does it is ‘censored’ in order to deceive the public. This almost
        unbelievable but perfectly true incident is as follows. During the night after we had
        relieved the Tommies prior to our attack on the ridge we were surprised to hear agonised
        cries of ’stretcher bearer’, ‘help’, ‘For God’s sake come here’ etc, coming from all sides
        of us. When daylight came some of us, myself included, crawled out to some adjacent shell
        holes from where the cries were coming and were astonished to find about <factor type="trauma"> half a dozen Tommies, badly wounded, some insane, others almost dead with
            starvation and exposure, lying stuck in the mud and too weak to move. We asked one man
            who seemed a little better than the rest what was the meaning of it and he said that if
            we cared to crawl about the shell holes all round about him we would find dozens more in
            similar plight.</factor>
      </p>
      <p>We were dumbfounded, but the awful truth remained. <emote type="negative">These chaps,
            wounded in the defence of their country, had been callously left to die the most awful
            of deaths in <factor type="conditions">the half frozen mud while tens of thousands of
                able bodied men were camped within five miles of them behind the lines.</factor>
         </emote> All these Tommies (they were mostly men of the York and Lancaster Regiment) had
        been wounded during their unsuccessful attack on the ridge which we afterwards tried to take
        and at the time when we came upon them they must have been <factor type="conditions">lying
            where they fell in the mud and rain for four days and nights.</factor> Those that were
        still alive had subsisted on the rations and water that they had carried with them or else
        had taken it from dead comrades beside them. <emote type="negative">I have seen some pretty
            rotten sights during the two and half years of active service, but I must say that this
            fairly sickened me.</emote> We crawled back to our trenches and inside of an hour all
        our stretcher bearers were working like the heroes that they were, and in full view of the
        enemy who, to his credit, did not fire on them. <emote type="negative">They worked all day
            carrying out those Tommies of whom I am afraid some will be mad men for the rest of
            their lives even if they do recover from their wounds and exposure</emote>.</p>
      <p>Carrying wounded over such country often knee deep in mud is the most trying work imaginable,
        and I do not say for a moment that the exhausted Tommies (the survivors of the first attack
        on Passchendale Ridge) whom we relieved should have tried to carry them out for I do not
        believe that any of them were physically capable of doing it, but I do say that it was part
        of their officers’ duty to send back to the rear of the lines and have fresh men brought up
        to carry out the wounded that they themselves could not carry. <emote type="negative">
            Perhaps they did send back for help, but still the fact remains that nothing was done
            until our chaps came up, and whoever is responsible for the unnecessary sacrifice of
            those lives deserves to be shot more than any Hun ever did.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>If they had asked for an armistice to carry out their wounded I do not doubt that it would
        have been granted for the Huns had plenty of wounded to attend to as well as the Tommies.
            <emote type="negative">I suppose our armchair leaders call this British stubbornness. If
            this represents British stubbornness then it is time we called it by a new name. I would
            suggest callous brutality as a substitute.</emote> Apparently this is not an isolated
        instance of its kind. <emote type="negative">While we were in reserve for two days to the
            Brigade which finally took over from us I was having a look around some old German
            dugouts and in one of them I came upon about fifty dead Tommies all lying spread out
            over the floor as though they had been thrown in there hastily. They had evidently been
            dead some months. I asked an artillery Sergeant Major standing near by how they all came
            to be in there and he told me that they had been put in there (while wounded) during the
            advance last July, and had been forgotten. If this were true then it is even worse than
            the case just mentioned, for these dugouts must have been within a mile of our main
            dressing stations at the time when the advance took place, and the distance to carry
            them was thus five times less than in the other case. </emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="negative"> After reading this do not believe our lying press, who tell you that
            all the brutality of this war is on the Huns’ side. The Hun is no angel, we all know,
            and the granting of an armistice such as that which we had is a rare occurrence. The
            particular Regiments who were holding the ridge at the time our attack are known as
            ‘Jaegers’. Probably the Prussians or most of the other Hun Regiments do not ask for
            armistices, but for all the terrific casualties those Jaegers inflicted on us, we
            survivors of Passchendaele Ridge must all admit that they played the game on that

      <p>Have arrived in India for the purpose of relieving some A1 (military fitness category meaning
        capable of active service overseas) men here who have been here for a long period. It's not
        a bad show here just above Delhi but <factor type="conditions">so d____d hot: risen to 106
            degrees in the shade and we have more hot weather just coming.</factor> Our parades are
        as follows 6.30-7.45 and 9 to 10 and finish for day. <emote type="positive">There is an
            abundance of sport and grub here. Fancy getting eggs laid too. A supper of say new
            mutton chop, potatoes, peas, broccoli and tea 4d.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>The things that are expensive are goods from England especially English soap, sauces, writing
        paper and of course we are unable to get English made fags. We had a grand journey from
        England; route was Southampton to Cherbourg then to Italy. In Italy we went to Alexandria,
        stayed there three days <emote type="positive">had a grand time, streets of red lamps etc.
            and lovely shops. No two houses in main stretch are alike.</emote> Then from Alexandria
        we come to Port Suez by train then on P. and O. Liner Kaiser I. Hind to Bombay had two days
        there and that's a grand place too, lovely wide streets and grand buildings. They have a sea
        front very much like Hastings and all the big boys have their after dinner drive there and
        form a queue by shore. Some stuff there too. Lots of Europeans knocking about too. <emote type="positive"> Had a game of footer for the Railway Operatives depot last night, 6pm,
            with Kingls Own and won. But it was so ruddy warm and I felt like a wash out at finish.

         <salute>Dear Old Girl,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>Here goes for another small note to swell your budget at the post and to relate events.<emote type="positive">Thus far I have been as lazy as I can be. Yesterday and the day before I
            have been buzzing around during the day doing a fair amount of necessary shopping, and
            temp(?) now almost fined up for my immediate wants - except for what the tailor is
            making.</emote> Will cease that sort of uncertainty till just before I go back when I
        shall plunge in and buy any bulky stuff I want to take back. And talking of shopping -<emote type="negative">I can't make up my mind what to get for you. You have asked of course
            for something that would do for our home - but so far I haven't got any further ahead
            with the choosing.</emote>
         <emote type="positive">Then in one of your last letters you
            talked of some blouse materials you coveted, and that gave me inspiration</emote>- if I
        could only land somebody to choose them. I've another idea too. I shall try it on. Don't be
        curious, mum, and you won't be told no lies.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">Yesterday afternoon I met(redacted)'s office of the Otago Regiment,
            and we had several games of five and a swim at the Royal Automobile Club. We also spent
            the evening together smoking and yarning. The day before I had dinner with Charley
            Foradick and later on we went round to the Waldorf Hotel to look up Geddis who was
            staying there only another day or two of leave to run. We found him just turning in, so
            dug him out of bunk and held a party in his room till a very later hour, when we left
            him in peace and went our several ways to beds</emote>. Geddis -- commonly known to us
        as "Little Willie" has a great attraction at a place called Livydon(?) not very far from
        London - a pretty girl who has absorbed most of his attention during his leaves. I half
        suspected to find him getting married this time. Forsdick and I offered our assistance and
        promised to make fitting speeches if he would arrange the ceremony; but he said the time was
        not yet ripe and offered to make it a double event with me.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="neutral">Did I ever tell you, dear, that the word of our engagement was bruited
            around the N.Z.E.F in France sometime about March last?</emote>Well there is a paper of
        N.Z. news called the "New Zealander" printed by some benevolent person and issued free to us
        periodically, and there it was - copied of course from N.Z. papers. <emote type="positive">I
            have been collecting congratulations from then on.</emote>Dearest old chap, things are
        not pouring out of my throat onto the paper with the greatest of ease. Same old
            complaint.<emote type="negative">I feel that I am getting very stale and as dull as
            dishwater, and since Forsdick wants to take me to meet some of the friends he has made
            in England I shall be only too pleased to take the opportunity and try to combat the
            tendency.</emote> I wouldn't be surprised if that is what I need. A man deprived of
        feminine society grows rough edges after a time too - I'm sure I don't know what you'll find
        me like when I get back to you, old chap. You'd better collect some files and sandpaper for
        the process of smoothing me off again! Darling girl,keep your pecker up and smile. <emote type="negative">I think I miss you more on leave than at any other time.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="negative">It feels so much like burning daylight to be without you in a place
            like this. Quite different from being with the company where I wouldn't have you come
            for the world - much as I long for you.</emote> Do you see, old chap? Stop me, old lady
        - I"m getting to be a confirmed growler. <emote type="positive">I am fit and well,
            dear.</emote>
         <emote type="negative">Always very much love and longing for you. I've almost forgotten what
            it feels like to have you in my arms.</emote>
         <emote type="positive">But someday I'm going to remind both of us just exactly what it's
            like. Let's have a big wish together for the chance to come soon.</emote> In the
        meantime, sweetheart, there is always "this". All my love for your dear old self.</p>

         <salute>Dear</salute>
         <name type="person">Sir,</name>
      </opener>
      <p> I trust you will excuse the liberty I have taken in writing you, after such a long absence
        from England, but the difficulties of active service is my excuse, although I am sorry to
        say laziness has a lot to do with it.</p>
      <p> No doubt you will wonder what I am doing wasting my time in Malta; well, I came here last
        January through <factor type="trauma">an attack of dysentery followed by
            constipation</factor>, there I remained, and am likely to do so, unless something very
        unexpected happens.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">I have been taken on the temporary staff, and am acting as parade
            staff sergeant, quite a nice easy position, except when we are receiving or sending
            troops away.</emote>
      </p>
      <p> How are things in general, looking at Paddington, I suppose the office is full of ladies and
        men who are over the age limit.</p>
      <p> I saw a Great Western Magazine a few days ago, and I noticed that a large number of the
        'chiefs' have retired, also that Artlett has not given up trying to bring sports honours to
        the Audit with the Bowls team.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">The weather here is absolutely glorious, and our camp is right against
            the sea, we get some lovely bathing and boating, in fact it is almost as good as any
            resort in England.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>We are about ten miles from Valletta, but we can always get a ride in a motor lorry or a
        gharry (horse-drawn cab) I have only met one G.W. man since I have been here and that is
        Cowles of the Agreements. He has been here since the Dardanelles; and he is acting chief
        clerk to the commanding officer of the Company Camp...</p>
      <p>I have not given up hope of getting to England yet, as since I have been here <factor type="trauma">I have contracted malaria, also my heart is not good enough to allow me to
            carry a pack for a while</factor>, so I have been marked unfit for over three months,
        and I may give you all a surprise by walking into the office one of these fine days.</p>
      <p> Well, sir, when is the war going to end, I think it would have been all over now, bar the
        shouting, if it had not been for Russia.</p>
      <p>I think the Great Western Railway according to the magazine have reaped a fair share of the
        awards for bravery etc, on the field.</p>
      <p>Well, sir, I trust it will not be long before I have the pleasure of receiving a reply to my
        letter, and kindly remember me to all that are left of the old room 19</p>

         <salute>Dear Mick</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>After a very <emote type="positive">delightful &amp; peaceful</emote> voyage across the
        Meditteranean the long &amp; rugged arms of Marseilles Harbour enclose us safely; and with
        the French green trees &amp; <factor type="conditions">mild sunshine the blue water &amp;
            cooling breezes</factor> one may perhaps for an hour forget. Forget now for an hour the
        awful country we have left, I trust for ever as far as Im concerned. <emote type="positive">My health state is good and improving</emote>. This break is annoying but we may resume
        our journey tomorrow. I will let you know by wire my progress towards London. The worst is
        over &amp; I feel I shall arrive in good trim possibly 4 to 5 days after you receive
        this.</p>
      <p>The mess room is demobilizing itself. Once a smart hut capable of dining about 30 officers in
        style. Brick walls, timber roof, Egyptian colours on the walls. Roof still there, walls
        demobilizing colours blending artistically having lost most of their suddeness on the
        Tussour shirts of the tired Heads. (Tired exhausted Heads Staff Officers.) <factor type="conditions">Thousands of flies</factor>, that likeThethe Intelligent. Natives
        realize that the screens are faulty and hop in for Their cut while the going is good"
        (Australian for Seize your opportunity"). The comparison between parasites and intelligent
        Natives must not be laboured as this is even now a military letter and the Censor may even
        at this stage be on the spot, namely doing his duty under terrific odds. Outside this bit of
        shade (111 Fahrenheit) there is a blaze of almost colourless light and it takes, even for an
        experienced savage like myself, a few seconds to locate the differences between sand, tents
        and sky. In this blaze work still goes on, army work which is like every other kind of work,
        I meeself yesterday sat out in the blaze and did an accurate drawing of a cacolet (Cacolet
        two stretchers attached to camel for field ambulance work). [See image for drawing.] The
        work goes on but with that greatest of all physical efforts, the effort to do ones duty
        during the last hours of a long contract.</p>
      <p>There have been backslidings and senseless noise and a scrap here and there but I am dealing
        now with myself and the men who appeal to me. The others can be dealt with by the
        A.P.M.inand possibly by some damned journalist who sings the song of the Bolschevick. I am
        writing because I have no duties for two or three hours, merely finishing my diary, packing
        my stuff or rather assisting my offsider to do it. I shall finish I hope a sketch of Ismalia
        this evening. But to our muttons Take my man. <factor type="prep">He is carefully
            rearranging &amp; packing pictures, materials, clothes</factor> &amp;c. renovating cases
        with nails he has to find patiently, thoroughly. A group of men the last of the A.P.Ms
        outfit ride past in the same old Australian manner taking their horses down to water.
        Perhaps tomorrow their horses will be handed in but today they will be watered, fed,
        groomed, and told with the harsh voice which conceals emotion that they are Bastards. Just
        alongside my hut Signals (Telegraph &amp; Telephone Office) keeps up its monotonous Moascar,
        Moascar, Yes Sir or Hello! How she go" as the case requires. Sometimes the call rings or
        burrs and the worn out operator fails to hear it at once, his offsider or the man who is
        about to relieve him wakes up and giving a rub to his face with a towel to removegetsome of
        the sweat &amp; sleepinessfrom his face</p>
      <p>walks over to the receiver &amp; takes the call after which he curses his mate who wakes up
        &amp; continues Moascar"! Some swell writer or some swollen writer used to say, The Time (or
        Times, the day, or the period) was big with portent. Anticipation of great things to come is
        of course the sheet anchor of the hopeful child and disappointed adult. We that is Us" are
        in or near to the land where conception gained the word Divine after many million years of
        primitive literary effort, and the most of us are still willing to create &amp; build in our
        work and all of us are capable of doing our humble part in the productive process of
        bringing more men &amp; women into the world but to have to clean up, something my dear wife
        that you understand, is Hell and must be done; and I want to express not so much wonder at
        myself because I have many interests but at the war" generally and to say finally that this
        day is big. Incident every minute. A sentry standing to attention, merely as a matter of
        habit. This page was interrupted by the sound of a horse grunting and a man cursing and I
        ran into the blaze to see what is possibly the last buck jumper trying to get his man off
        just as if the war was beginning.</p>

         <salute>Dear Gerald,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>No doubt, perhaps you had thought I had forgotten old friends at Paddington, but such is not
        the case. We so not have much spare time for letter writing now. To tell you of all our
        adventures since we left England would take too long here to relate but I will save for when
        I come home. Perhaps you have heard, we were only at Farnborough four days, before we were
        sent over there. By God, old chap we did have a time of it, the first fortnight. Living on
        bully beef and biscuits, <factor type="prep">travelling day and night and sleeping
            anywhere</factor> and doing long tramps with full kit on nearly done us in as we had no
        training. We managed to stick it through, but I thought poor Percy Smith would have to give
        in as he was very queer with toothache. The first six weeks we moved about from place to
        place <factor type="prep">doing all sorts of fatigue work</factor>, bar our own. Lambert,
        Smith, Collins and myself are now settled down in H the place where Mr Lakers son was so
        long at. Collins and Lambert have been fortunate enough to get temporary clerical work
        during the last months. </p>
      <p>I was promised one when on the 17th of last month <emote type="negative">I was <factor type="trauma">wounded</factor> by a <factor type="battle">bomb</factor>
         </emote> from
        a taube which landed clean through our billet at 12 oclock at night, when we were all sound
        asleep. I caught it in the thigh, but luckily it was only a flesh wound, but <emote type="negative">I had some <factor type="trauma">awful bruises</factor> from the
            debris</emote> which fell on it. I have been in hospital ever since at the base, but I
        am pleased to say <emote type="positive">I am now nearly well again</emote> and in a
        convalescent camp three miles from there, overlooking the sea. We are not allowed to put our
        address at the heading of a letter so I will put it here:</p>
      <p> 2AM /W.P. Mansbridge No.16929, Royal Flying Corps No. G 21 Hut no. 6 Convalescent Depot,
        A.P.O. S.17, British Expeditionary Force. After I am discharged from here, I shall be sent
        up to the base and then up the line with the best of luck as the Tommies say out here. I am
        hoping to get back to H as I was so happy and with such decent fellows there, but I dont
        think it probable. Lambert, Smith and myself, often used to talk of old times and wondered
        how things were at Paddington. I daresay Gerald, there are not many young fellows left in
        the Audit are there, has Mr Horsley gone? Do drop me a line when you have time, as I assure
        you old boy, it is a real treat to hear Paddington news. <emote type="positive">I have never
            felt in better health</emote>, army life certainly agrees with me also with Lambert.
        Billy Button is at headquarters, got a cushy job. I believe I saw him once there, but I have
        no idea where the other G.W. fellows are. I am afraid I am not very fluent with my French
        yet, I could have done with your services on several occasions. How are Mr Slater and other
        members of the Stats. (or is that department disbanded?) Please remember kindly to them.
        (Lines censored) Cannot stop to write more now as I am just off to a concert in the Y.M.C.A.
        hut in the camp here.</p>

        the place I am at, E- s. [Etaples]. Do you ever hear anything of the other boys out
        here?</postscript>

         <salute>Dear Bob,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>Now for another budget concerning this trip so far. Well, I left Brisbane on the 21st Dec. at
        6.30 A.M. by train for Sydney, arrived at Roma Street at 7 A.M. changed engines for a B.17
        and then started on our long journey. The farewell at that Station is something that shall
        never be forgotten by most men on that train. My people couldn't get into Brisbane to see me
        as the train I was on left too early before the train from Wynnum arrived in Brisbane, so I
        said a final good-bye the night before. I shall never forget that particular night. I always
        though it took <emote type="negative">something very awful</emote> to break me up, <factor type="trauma">but that night broke me up completely</factor>. I would give anything now
        to have just a look at my dear home and parents, but <factor type="conditions">the ship is
            taking me further away</factor> each kick with the propeller. Anyhow I am looking
        forward in the future to seeing Wynnum and my parents after I have done my duty at the
        front. In camp at Enoggera is a splendid life to be at: he can go where he likes, but when
        once you leave for the front you are tied down to orders, now one has to be a dinkum
        soldier, <emote type="negative">I can see how it is one doesn't want to enlist</emote>, but
        I do not dislike the game, I am only giving you the idea of the whole concern so far as I
        have seen of it.</p>

         <salute>My dear old Jack &amp; Clare,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p> Got your (Jacks) letter of 23 April to day &amp; got one from Clare a couple of weeks
            ago. Well Im glad to see that things are all well so far. Very sorry to hear about Ted
            &amp; I hope he has fully recovered by this. Also that he was not out of work long
            through it all. My word the kidlets must be growing. I suppose they are "some" handful
            by now. Hope the Arbitration award panned out satisfactorily to all concerned. Give my
            love to Ede Al &amp; all of the folk. Uncle Will wrote &amp; told me they had had a
            splendid trip up you way as far as Mt Morgan. He was then off to Mildura for a few days.
            I wrote you all a post card last week. Remember me to Bob Anderson &amp; tell him Ill
            write shortly. My word the works must be like old times with all those hands up there.
                <factor type="conditions">I am out in the desert</factor> still &amp; at present
            with another officer &amp; two troops stationed well out. <emote type="positive">We are
                having a glorious time</emote> as far as soldiering goes, and appear to be quite
            safe from any attacks. Of course everyone wants something to happen, but that sort of
            skite comes from the new bloods. All the old hands recognise the good wicket they are on
            &amp; say nix.</p>
      <p>Our horses are in good nick &amp; get well looked after. <emote type="neutral">The <factor type="conditions">desert sun is very hot</factor> but
            we have managed to get a little shelter rigged here</emote> &amp; there, which proves a great
            boon. Rations are good as can be &amp; we are having a real good turn. Of course weve
            earned it. Ive got three splendid nags &amp; you can bet were good pals. Ive picked up a
            good knowledge of horses here &amp; do some enjoyable rides. We are too far from the
            canal for swimming but will get a turn there bye &amp; bye. There have been one or two
            stunts of which the papers will have published in detail ere this. A week or so ago an
            aeroplane flew over one of the L.H. camps &amp; <factor type="battle">dropped fifteen bombs</factor> accounting for 9
            men &amp; 14 horses killed. It was "No man standing" for a few jiffs. Of course he
            caught them at stables so was able to do a double shift &amp; get away. <emote type="neutral">The desert is
            not very interesting</emote> from a physical aspect, but it is marvellous to see the wonderful
            hiding places to be found everywhere in it. Everything is sand &amp; the wind makes some
            tremendous mounds &amp; some equally tremendous hollows. I have seen hollows quite two
            hundred feet deep. </p>
      <p>I saw Walter Barrett but he has gone to France for sure by this. He looked well &amp; was
            very keen on it. You might remember me to Allie. Has W.K. arrived that way yet. Im so
            sorry all the boys got out of work &amp; I guess Mother had a bad time of it. Hope she
            is alright now. Tell Clare I havent had a chance to see that Aunt of hers, but will do
            so if I get a chance. We are about 50 miles across desert from Port Said, so you see I
            might see her ere long. Lizzie is in Adelaide. Her letters are very gloomy, and she
            seems very dissatisfied all round. Im very sorry, but were in this now till were let
            out, so its about time she got that view of it. She hasnt been at all short of money in
            any way &amp; ought to be putting on a brighter face than her letters indicate. Young
            Will is evidently a boshter. I got several letters from people in the Hill. One from Geo
            Robinson containing real spicy congratulation from Jim Hebbard. He reckons Im right on a
            royal welcome from him if he ever sees me again, so that was rather cheering.</p>
      <p>Well old man thats about all this time. Ill have such a lot to tell you when I come home
            that youll wish it could have been your luck to come. However your job is at home as Ive
            told you in most of my previous efforts. Things are looking bright for me in several
            ways. When I get back &amp; if they do well both you &amp; Ted will get the call. So in
            the meantime look well after Clare, the kiddies, &amp; yourself with ever grateful love
            to you both from </p>

      <p>Just a note as we are on the move for another camp &amp; <emote type="negative">things are upside down</emote>. Got a
            letter from you last mail &amp; judge that you have been having a rough time. Gee-whiz
            but you must have a few howling matches there occasionally. Hope dear old Clare is OK
            also Allie K. Give Clare my love. Also tell her that I wrote to Mrs Dye &amp; she has
            invited me up to Pt Said. As things are now of course I cant get away just for a while.
            We are expecting to be brawling with Johnny Turk &amp; hope to give him a load or two.
            <factor type="prep">Things are greatly stirred here just now</factor>. Any way, the Devil looks after his own so have
            no fear &amp; expect a line of more length shortly from your lovingly</p>

      <p>Just a short note to let you know <emote type="positive">Im still going strong</emote> &amp; feeling hale &amp; hearty.
            You will have read in the papers during the past few weeks of us having been in a bit of
            a go &amp; making some captures, well we are still a long way away from any fixed camp
            or convenience &amp; will probably be in this state for another month. <factor type="battle">The fighting
            seems to have settled</factor> right out &amp; no Turks about worth speaking of. We are camped
            out near to where we had our last fight as our horses couldnt have gone much further at
            the pace we had to work. My word it is the first big Light Horse work of the war and it
            has been most interesting throughout. I only wish we have more stunts like it. <factor type="battle">Our
            casualties were not very great</factor> &amp; its surprising in open country how much lead it
            takes to pot a man. You would like to see the date oases. Just now all the dates are
            ripe &amp; there are tons &amp; tons everywhere. The country here is soft drift sand for
            miles &amp; miles &amp; then in the hollows one drops on a clump of palms (4 or 5 acres
            as a rule). Can get water almost any where at a depth of 2 ft and although brackish
            quite good &amp; drinkable so you see desert work is not so arduous as the story books
            make out. Of course there are plenty of drawbacks, but what are we here for?</p>
      <p>Certainly theres any amount of growling but you can bet your life its not too bad at all,
            at all. Got a cheery letter from Ede &amp; Phil the other day. They seem on a good
            wicket &amp; also mention that things are alright with you &amp; Al. I guess youre kept
            busy old man, but keep going. I hope to be a help to you when I get back, which may not
            be so long now Rumania is in. As for Al &amp; Ted give them my best love &amp; tell them
            I hope to be able to "do a bit" when I get back. I wrote to Mrs Dye &amp; got a very
            kind invitation to Port Said, but owing to beinginvitedon this stunt, I couldnt get
            there. I think Mrs Dye will have left for India ere this. She was due to leave about a
            month ago. Im sorry as I would liked to have met them. Give Clare my fondest regards
            also all the kiddies. My word they must be growing up. Hope Clare is absolutely OK. Also
            Alice. Got a letter from Vera Godkin. They all seem well. Lizzie is going well &amp;
            young Wills last photo showed him as a fine boy. They are in Adelaide. Well old boss,
            more later. Paper very scarce just at present. Remember me to Bob and Bess Anderson will
            you also my old friends. Got a real splendid message from Jim Hebbard &amp; the Central
            chaps two mails ago. Well old man you know the good things I wish you both adieu till we
            meet again</p>

      <p>Got an undated letter from you today but should think it was posted in September. My word
            old horse you sound cheerful but you are not having the best of time. However I hope the
            furnaces are now going O.K. again &amp; things are straightening. I am sending you along
            a fiver for Xmas &amp; hope it arrives safely to give you &amp; the kids a day out in
            commemoration. Dear old Clare I hope she is doing well. I had made full arrangements to
            call on Mrs Dye but <factor type="battle">the Turks came</factor> &amp; I did not see. I think she has now gone to
            India but will find out for certain soon as we are now in a camp having arrived here
            yesterday evening. <emote type="positive">Its great to be <factor type="conditions">in a tent</factor> again</emote> &amp; tomorrow I hope to have the
            luxury of sleeping in a bed even if it is only made of feed-bags. You can guess it will
            go alright after not having seen one for three months. Tell Clare she neednt growl about
            her luck. <emote type="negative">We suffer here with <factor type="conditions">too little bed</factor>
         </emote>. Glad the kidlets are doing so well. Yes I
            would like a snap of them very much. Sorry Barrett is wounded &amp; hope its nothing
            very serious. I had heard about Annie Gainer. Its bad luck but it looks almost like a
            judgment. Give my love to Ede &amp; Al &amp; the other tribes. You didnt mention Al or
            Ted. Hope they are going alright. Am sending Al along a couple of quidlets for Xmas.</p>
      <p>I am going to a Cavalry School for a course on Monday. Its quite a new thing &amp; at
            present only meant for senior officers. I feel quite favored at being sent along &amp;
            you can bet Im a trier. Will let you know how I get on. Its at Cairo. We are still miles
            out in the desert so of course it will be quite a good change too. The square head is
            getting it hot now. Next summer will see it all over. The smaller fry will peter out
            &amp; then well get the Kaisers push. Its just a case of time tells only the push hurts
            the longer it goes. Jacko has left this country pretty well but hell still be a nuisance
            for some time. Theyll all go though before this time next year. Well old boss more in a
            week or so. I may cable or I may post the fiver. Hope it comes in time for Xmas. Fondest
            love to you &amp; Clare &amp; the kidlets &amp; all the tribes. Will see you after the
            war alright. Tooraloo</p>

            it. I hope I can say the same in a week or so as we are expecting some scrap in a few
            days &amp; I think its going to be heavy at that. However well wait for it before we say
            any more. Im afraid Im very poor at sending you any description of these things but Ill
            tell you all about it when I come back. Hope everybody is quite well. Your last letter
            seemed to show you in a bit of a mix up. I was intending to send you a few quidlets as a
            Xmas cheerer but was unable to do so. Should you want a few quid let Lizzie know. Her
            last address was B.H. Shell always do anything possible for you too &amp; you know its
            your just dues. I think she can manage it alright for you &amp; I am writing her on the
            subject in case you find it necessary. Sorry old chapsies to hear of all the bad luck,
            but dont get downhearted. This will all end soon &amp; things will be alright. Wait till
            I come home. Youll be quite surprised the way things are going to go. So cheers. Hope
            dear old Clare is up to form again. And also all the kids &amp; Al &amp; Ted &amp; all
            the others. Tell them some day to expect a letter each, but I dont know when. <emote type="negative">We are

            havent got any of the old letters here. Now heaps &amp; heaps of love to you all. Youll

      <p>It is quite a long time since I wrote you or received any from you. I think I wrote Clare
            after receiving her boshter cake &amp; I hope you got that alright. I never got Edes
            pudding &amp; whether it fell through the mail-bag or not is a matter of conjecture.
            Perhaps they thought by the weight it was a bomb or shell &amp; heaved it out of the
            mail. I believe the maximum weight allowed though is 11 lbs. Still hard luck. It may
            turn up yet &amp; I am living in hopes. Glad to see things are brightening again old
            cock. You are certainly having a very rough time of it. Everybody is but I think you are
            getting more than your share. However I am very pleased to see you are both as game as
            ever. Old pals I hope to be a bit of use when I got back &amp; whatever comes my way be
            sure you are the first for a "cut". Poor old Al &amp; Ted have been up against it a lot.
            I must write them today. Both Ede &amp; Nell seem very happy. I often get letters from
            Morgan now. Vera &amp; Win &amp; Nell all take a turn. Suppose all the kids are quite
            grown up now &amp; swanky. Would like to see them. Youve certainly got a crowd round
            you. How would a farm go? Youd have enough labor to work it. I often get letters from
            the firm &amp; think if you care about it I could work the oracle for you when I get
            back to get fixed up in something good. So keep battling &amp; save those quarter shares
            of [Tatts?]. Hope youve hooked some more ere this. </p>
      <p>We had our last battle in Palestine.<emote type="positive"> Its a wonderful country</emote>, what we saw of it. And I
            would like a chance at getting land there. The horses had a good go in on wheat crops.
            We lost 4 officers. It makes one think a bit. However Ive got a good way of standing
            side on. My name went in for a decoration but dont know if it will come out. Some do
            &amp; some dont. I tried to transfer to the flying Corps but my Colonel wouldnt stand
            me. And he wont give me a rise so there you are. Still all good things come to those who
            wait. Got a letter from Aunt Molly w.a. &amp; Tommy in France some weeks ago. They both
            mentioned receiving letters from you. I have written them. Lizzie must be very
            downhearted. I get very few letters from her lately. 2 in seven weeks. I guess shes
            pretty miserable. Think this will end this year. We are doing much more than the papers
            say in the way of preparation. The Hit of the war will be about May &amp; it will finish
            one way or other then. Love to you both &amp; the kidlets. Keep up bravely as you have
            done, the road is sure to get easier directly</p>

      <p>Aye full well this is a week of anniversaries. In addition to the <emote type="positive">wonderful days</emote> of me homecoming it is also the 4th anniversary of the days a
        hundred thousand of us Digger soldiers first smelt war's gunpowder &amp; received our
        baptism of fire. Last Monday the 19th was the anniversary of the Battle of Fromelles when
        the 5th Division got so <factor type="battle">horribly cut up</factor>: then tomorrow the
        22nd , 4 years ago saw the big stunt of Pozieres launched. Shall I ever forget this night
        then, --- the eve of the battle. We were – the stretcher-bearers, mobilised in a village
        about 7 miles behind the line. Darkness fell, &amp; <factor type="prep">each man was ordered
            to stand by to be ready to move off at a moments notice</factor>.</p>
      <p>The preliminary bombardment had already started &amp; we could hear <factor type="sense">the
            shattering roar of the big guns</factor> posted in the rear not far, from where we were.
        After 'standing to', till mid-night, the welcome order came to move forward – welcome only
        because it meant action, the awful waiting &amp; <emote type="negative">period of <factor type="prep">inaction</factor> at such times is the thing that tries one's
            nerves</emote>. At daybreak we had reached the area immediately behind the front
        trenches &amp; were at once in the thick of it. The next few hours I have only a <emote type="negative">nightmarish remembrance of- I was <factor type="battle">helping poor

         </emote> (we hadn't got used to them then)
        &amp; getting them back into comparative safety then back again for others. About 10 o'clock
        I met Tony. We were in different units then &amp; hadn't seen each other for weeks. Shall I
        ever forget that meeting. The rivulsion of fooling at seeing a dear familiar face so
        unexpectedly &amp; under such conditions knocked me completely of my perch &amp; I blubbered
        like a kid. I was ashamed but it did me the world of good, the nervous tension was broken,
        &amp; ever after through all the stunt if the next 3 days, I was right as a trivet &amp;
        felt not the strain at all. I wrote to the old cobber last night. Do you wonder how I love
        him?</p>
      <p>Little did we think it possible that 4 years hence we'd be safely back in the homeland
        writing by a cosy fire with nothing more terrifying than the crackling sparks to remind us
        of former fireworks. Then the homecoming last year. Though it was sadly clouded, there was
        that bright single ray, when followed brought me to you. <emote type="positive">Hope burned
            within me</emote> from the time it was illuminated during the period of our
        correspondence, &amp; the first sight of your dear face on that Monday afternoon, set the
        glow of ever, As long as life lasts &amp; in the hereafter Yes, my beloved I thank God for
        all His goodness. 'His mercies endueth forever'. I loved your last letter, Em It breathed
        the pure tender purpose of a high ideal, &amp; together we will strive to attain that lofty
        plane of true &amp; perfect Love. When I revisit the past twelve months my heart overflows
        in a paen of happy rejoicing. It has given me you, the gentlest, sweetest truest &amp; best
        lassie man can be blest with. May I ever be worthy of my great possession. I'll write no day
        by day news this time dear. Will reserve till our next. Good night my love, may sweet sleep
        give you all his rest.</p>

      <p>No doubt you think that I have forgotten all about you and my friends of the Audit, but never
        let it be said (this is an army term, if you please.) Truth to tell I have been going to
        write time after time, but have had to put it off for various reasons. I am taking this
        opportunity of writing to you, while I am in charge of tonights guard. I get this job about
        once a week now, its not so bad, I have three men and a man in waiting; we mount at 5pm and
        dismiss at 7am. We make ourselves <emote type="neutral">as comfortable as we can</emote>, in
        the guard tent, which just covers over the top of the sand bags, and these have got grass
        growing out of them now. The sand bags are about 4ft high and make a good protection. April
        1st I got my two stripes up, after being a 1st Air Mechanic for 12 months, the Non-
        Commissioned Officers have a very decent mess here, and everything is ok. I am corporal in
        charge of wireless, photographic, electrical and all instruments used on aeroplanes, I have
        had a very good education on all those subjects, but the one I like best is the wireless,
        its far more interesting than photography, which is a very big thing indeed out here, and a
        lot depends upon a good photograph of the Hun lines</p>
      <p>Yesterday I saw a nice little game between one of ours and one of theirs, after our <factor type="battle">anti-aircraft fire</factor> had taken it up a bit higher, our machine went
        for it and got well over the top of it, then two more of ours came along and forced it down,
        she tried all manner of tricks, but down she came alright, and landed a clean machine, not
        broken in any part, and the two Huns inside it quite well. </p>
      <p>We gave a revue (theatrical show) to our chaps here on the 13th, it went off alright, we
        started at 9pm and gave a two hours show, am enclosing programme, and will forward a photo
        of myself as the oldest inhabitant as soon as I receive them from the Frenchman who took
        themKind regards to all of the section and the remainder of the agreements, and hoping you
        are fit and well. Good bye.</p>

         <salute>Dear Mr Hunt,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>I was very pleased to receive your letter for which many thanks. It took nearly a fortnight
        to reach me as I have changed about a good deal lately from one division to another and it
        has followed me around. I am pleased to say <emote type="positive">I am still keeping very
            fit</emote> and going on in about the same way. I think the last time I wrote we were
        living in trucks. Well we have now moved into huts about ten feet square, which are <factor type="conditions">very comfortable</factor> although not quite as large as the trucks.
        They are well built and stand about a foot from the ground so keep very dry. We have two of
        them, one which we use as an office and the other to sleep and live in. We also have a tent
        which we use for keeping kits etc. in, but we shall probably sleep in it when the weather is
        a bit warmer.</p>
      <p>We have had some <factor type="conditions">lovely weather</factor> lately, quite like summer
        but rather cold at night. We had a great deal of snow last month also plenty of rain and
        wind, and were over the tops of our boots in mud. We are stationed at a very small village
        which stands very high (about 600 feet above sea level) you can guess it is a bit breezy at
        times. It is a one-eyed hole with only two cafes and no shops. We have all our meals cooked
        at one of the cafes, and <emote type="positive">we live very well</emote> although there is
        not very much variation in the menu. I have managed to have one or two musical evenings
        lately. The fiddle I bought appears to be a fairly good one but my fingers are not quite so
        nimble as they were. I am afraid I shall have to put in a month or twos practice before I
        get back to where I was before I came out here. Glad to hear you have taken it up again. We
        shall be able to get a band for our next lamb dinner whenever that will be.</p>
      <p>Things do not seem to make much of a move round this way. We get plenty of aeroplanes over
        and see a good many fights in the air. There have also been a good many <factor type="battle">shells dropped not very far away from us</factor>, but we have managed to
        dodge them so far although, one of our fellows, who comes from the Midland Railway and who I
        worked with for some time, has been wounded and sent to base. There is only one G.W. man
        anywhere near me as far as I know and that is Colcott from Chief Goods Managers Office but
        he is some distance away and I hadnt seen much of him. I was surprised to hear that Morris
        had gone into the R.F.C. (Royal Flying Corps) after being rejected for the Infantry. I was
        also surprised and sorry to hear about Jack Symons. I had heard nothing about it. How did it
        happen? It must be very quiet at the office now with so many gone. (Censored line). As you
        say it is quite a change from the old days. I have not yet come across any of those who
        joined the R.E. (Royal Engineers) Transport lately. Did you know that Arthur Watton has
        joined?</p>
      <p>We had a concert party belonging to one of the divisions stationed round here, staying in the
        village last week, and they gave us a show two nights running. They had a proper stage with
        scenery and footlights, everything complete. <emote type="positive">They were very good
            indeed</emote>. The programme consisted of songs, sentimental and otherwise, also a
        Sketch and some Charlie Chaplin pictures which were very laughable as usual. Well, I dont
        think I can tell you much more at present. Please remember me to all at the office.</p>

      </opener>
      <p>I am writing this on the evening of the first day of the new year. <factor type="prep">We
            came into the trenches (an emergency call)</factor> the day before yesterday, but we are
        in the reserve trenches, not the firing line. I am writing this in my dugout (about two feet
        high and five feet long) by the miserable light of a guttering, little bit of candle. Soon
        it will go out, and then (for it’s only 5.30 and a wild night) come the long, long dark
        hours until ‘stand to’ in the morning.</p>
      <p> Last night, old year’s night, was <emote type="negative">a nightmare evening</emote>. At 1
        o’clock, the troops in the front line made two <factor type="battle">bomb attacks</factor>
        on the German front line, and we’d to support them. For an hour, it was literally hell upon
        earth. I had to spend most of the time crouched in the mud by the side of a machine gun. It
        was going nearly all the time, and the <factor type="sense">noise nearly stunned me, then
            the sickly smell of cordite</factor>, and the dense masses of steam from the water
        cooler didn’t improve matters. Both our artillery and theirs were going for all they were
        worth, and they lit up the sky. You could see some of the shells going through the air,
        swift, red streaks. Then an <factor type="battle">incessant stream of bullets from both
            sides, bombs, trench mortars, making a hellish din</factor>, and the sky lit up with a
        mad medley of shells, searchlights, star lights, the green and red rockets (used for
        signalling purposes); just about an hour of hell, and that was our introduction to the year
        of 1916! This morning I learned that we lost about 80 men and several officers, so that it
        cost us pretty dearly. </p>
      <p> I enjoyed the parcel hugely, and the pudding was splendid! Please thank Mrs What’s-her-name
        for her kind gift. It is very comfortable. I’m afraid that you would hardly recognise me if
        you saw me now. <factor type="conditions">It is three days since I had a shave, and two
            since I had a wash. I’m a mask of mud. My hair is matted</factor>, and I resemble an
        Australian beachcomber.</p>
      <p> This is morning of Jan. 2nd. We go into the firing line this afternoon for four days. By the
        way, if you can get hold of any old paperbacked sixpenny novels (such as Jacobs, Stanley
        Weyman – light stuff) please send some in your next parcel. No magazines; there’s not enough
        reading matter and the quality is bad. Only old copies, you know, don’t buy new ones.</p>
      <p>I saw a tin the other day, labelled Mackintosh’s Chocolate Toffee de Luxe. It sounds so weird
        that I’d like some if you can procure any, please!</p>

      <p>Just a few lines to let you know I arrived safely after visiting several places which I am
        not allowed to mention. <factor type="sense">This place is quite oriental</factor> as the fronts of the houses are for the
        most part looked after and kept in repair, while the backs are allowed to go, and it gives
        one a shock to see a fine building in the front, and then to go to the back and see it all
        neglected and ready to fall down. It is <factor type="conditions">very hot here during the day and the swarms of flies
        and mosquitoes keep one very busy</factor> and I <emote type="negative">dread</emote> to think what it will be like in the summer.
        It seems strange to see oxen drawing carts and donkeys with packs on, but it is a very
        common sight here. I sometimes have to go to the big steamers in a small pinnace [ships
        boat] and when it is rough it requires some nerve to walk along the sides of barges that are
        pitching and tossing and then climb up the ships side by a rope ladder, but it comes easier
        in time. It is<factor type="sense"> very mountainous here</factor>, and <emote type="positive">we get a very fine view of Mount Olympus and the
        snow-capped peaks.</emote> I had to go by motor up country the other day and I had to grip the side
        of the car as <factor type="conditions">the roads are awful</factor> and sometimes there is only just room for the car to
        travel and a sheer drop on the other side. The labourers at the docks are Greeks and when
        they are taken on in the mornings <emote type="neutral">it is a regular Babel till the Military Policeman <factor type="sense">uses his
        persuader (truncheon)</factor> right and left and that calms them somewhat.</emote> I have not met Mr Cox's
        son yet but should I do so I will make myself known to him. I have had to revert to sapper
        again as there are not sufficient men of our staff for us to remain N.C.O.s but if it is
        brought up to strength I am promised them again. The first person I saw here was Gray of the
        Stats (Statistical Department), and we are working together. Trusting that you are quite
        well and with kindest regards to Messrs Cox, Slater, Rogers and Hunt.</p>

      <p> I am pleased to say I am still in the same job and getting to understand the run of things. It
  is very interesting work, as you would imagine. It is a real line here, sometimes <factor type="prep">we are pushed and carry on till the early hours of the morning</factor>. I might say
  there is <emote type="neutral">no grumbling about tea money, overtime or bonus quotas</emote>
  putting in as much as eighteen hours a day sometimes and it would not do to send deputations to
  the chief who is also hard at it, in his room; there is a special way of dealing with such in the
  army.</p>
      <p>Of course one never knows how long this may last I may have marching orders to proceed elsewhere
  any day. Each day is absolutely a day unto itself here. We dont count tomorrow.</p>
      <p>I see you have been visited with a blizzard, we also have had <factor type="conditions">a severe
   touch of winter</factor> and at the present moment it is snowing hard outside. The shutters are
  closed and the work is being carried on by lamplight, this is necessary owing to the glass having
  recently left the windows in small fragments some souvenirs [shells] having called upon us. When
  the weather is fine we are fresh air fiends now both day and night except that we close the
  shutters when snowing or raining. The latter it is often doing.</p>
      <p>There are hosts of interesting things I could write you about but these will do later on when I
  have the pleasure of seeing you. Lieut. Duntons crowd was hereabouts, but I did not run up against
  him.</p>
      <p>I suppose the Derby* entries have commenced to run now. I met another GW fellow the other day,
  Sergeant Gregory, a Slough fellow. I think George Jones would know him. I have seen this fellow at
  Paddington but did not know him to speak to.</p>
      <p> I had a letter from Longmoor Camp. Must correct information. J. Higgs is in the Railway
  Transport Engineers with another friend of mine, Watton of Windsor who was in the Finance
  office</p>
      <p>Has Charlie Millcox come over this side of the water yet? I am looking out for him on all the
  transport wagons. I may run him down some day. Perhaps [he'll] be pleased to hear from him when
  you have the time. </p>

      <p>I left Aldershot on March 16th and travelled as far as Durban via Sierra Leone and Cape Town
        on the White Star Liner Suevic. <emote type="positive">This part of the journey was delightful</emote>, the <emote type="positive">
            <factor type="conditions">food</factor> and
        <factor type="conditions">accommodation</factor> was very good</emote> for a troopship. Of course this is accounted for by the fact
        that it is an Australian troopship. Everything was done that could be to make the journey
        enjoyable for the <factor type="sense">one thousand seven hundred men on board</factor>. We stayed just outside Sierre
        Leone for three days but were not allowed to leave. We arrived at Cape Town on Saturday
        afternoon four weeks after leaving Keyham and had a <factor type="prep">route march</factor> round the town the same
        evening. The next day we were allowed to roam about at will all day and <emote type="positive">a right jolly time
        we had</emote> although it was <factor type="conditions">very hot indeed</factor> for winter. <factor type="sense">Cape Town is a beautiful place</factor> and <emote type="positive">the
        inhabitants made our visit very enjoyable</emote>.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">The patriotism of the South African is wonderful</emote> to us after the coolness of the English
        (especially Aldershot). On the Monday we sailed for Durban arriving there on the Thursday
        evening after a <factor type="conditions">rather rough journey</factor> round the Cape. We did not land till the Saturday
        afternoon and then bid goodbye to the Suevic. She went on to Australia. We had two weeks at
        Durban and <emote type="positive">had a glorious time in a rest camp</emote> on Ocean Beach. Every day we went <factor type="conditions">bathing</factor> and
        only had <factor type="prep">parades</factor> up to 12 noon each day. The trams were free to us all over the city and
        invitations were showered upon us by the English residents. You can rest assured that we
        were very sorry to leave such a delightful spot, still all good things come to end and we
        finally had to go on board the Laconia belonging to the Cunard company for <emote type="negative">four weeks
        misery</emote>, we lay in the harbour for one week <emote type="negative">longing to go ashore</emote> before we started on the

        had to put up with a shirt inspection every day. <emote type="negative">The <factor type="conditions">food</factor> was bad and very little of it</emote> and
        to back it all up <emote type="negative">the canteen was rotten as well</emote>. <emote type="negative">I was glad to get to Bombay and get off
        such a <factor type="conditions">rotten ship</factor>
         </emote>. <emote type="neutral">I lost a stone in <factor type="trauma">weight</factor> during that four weeks.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>We arrived in India during the <factor type="conditions">monsoon period</factor> and have <emote type="negative">had plenty of rain more than we like</emote> I
        can assure you.</p>
      <p>Kirkee is only about hundred miles from Bombay and is about six thousand feet above the sea.
        We will while here never have the extremes of weather as the <factor type="conditions">climatic conditions</factor> are
        considered to be ideal here.</p>
      <p>Strange as it may seem to English people native women do most
        of the work here, and actually act as bricklayers labourers carrying pans of mortar on their
        heads, the men do very little indeed. <factor type="sense">Sunday is the same as any other day to them</factor>. As they
        have their own religious days when they have what they call Ram Jamees. All cartage is done
        by oxen and is rather slow and cumbersome. Kirkee Bazar is about three quarters of an hours
        walk from Pashan Camp and is rather interesting but is very dirty, <factor type="sense">children run about naked</factor>
        and the <factor type="conditions">drainage and dwellings</factor> are very bad indeed. <factor type="sense">Cigarettes</factor> made by the Turkish tobacco
        company Bandra can obtained for eleven annas (former unit of Indian currency) per 100
        (eleven pence) and are very good indeed, being better than the Nebka. Poona is the nearest
        city and is about five miles away. I walked there last Thursday to have a look round, this
        place boasts of one or two hotels and an Italian restaurant but is otherwise an exact
        counterpart of Kirkee and <factor type="sense">quite as dirty</factor>. The Italian restaurant is very good and is quite
        the equal of most London restaurants.</p>
      <p>We do not receive a very many <factor type="sense">letters</factor> out here, as the mail is so uncertain, <emote type="neutral">we never know
        when the next one will arrive.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>When you are writing you must let me know all the news, I
        wonder whether your section will ever be established again as it was before.</p>
      <p>Since I came out here I have taken up <factor type="prep">signalling</factor> and find it very useful, there is just a possibility I
        might be able to learn wireless, if so I dont doubt that it might be useful to me, when we
        get back to Blighty if there is half a chance to do so I will cease it.</p>
      <p>Our Battalion is at Aden and unless the signalling alters my destination I will eventually
        find myself there. <emote type="neutral">It is not exactly the place I should choose if I had my own way but of
        course there is no choice about it.</emote>
      </p>

         <salute>Dear Mr W.H. Davies,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>Just a line to let you know I have not forgotten you. I received a <factor type="sense">letter</factor> on Tuesday 3rd of
        January 1917 which you sent to me on August 24th 1916. By the marking on the envelope it has
        been round to various regiments and officers, but it has arrived quite safe at last. I
        received the <factor type="sense">letter</factor> you wrote in October quite safe. <emote type="neutral">I am sorry I have not written before
        but we were rather busy when I received your last letter and we could not send more than a
        <factor type="sense">field card</factor> for about a month.</emote>
         <emote type="positive">Well I am pleased to tell you that I am still going on first
        rate.</emote> I expect you will be surprised to hear that I have left the Northamptonshire Regiment
        and am now attached to the Army Printing and Stationary Services. We are opening a new
        branch in the photography line and I am here as a <factor type="prep">photographer</factor>.</p>
      <p>I am unable to tell you more than this up to the present. I expect Harry will be pleased to hear this as he used to give
        me quite a lot of tuition in this respect.</p>
      <p>There are only two of us here up to the present and <emote type="positive">as the <factor type="conditions">dark rooms</factor> are not finished yet we
        are having an easy time.</emote> The Officer is away in England just now getting some more
        photographic apparatus so we are on our own and I am in charge.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">We are <factor type="conditions">billeted</factor> with a company of Australian electricians, mechanics, mining and boring
        engineers and are having a fine time.</emote> There are a good lot of fellows and make us very
        welcome. <emote type="positive">We had a grand Xmas with them and they know how to enjoy themselves.</emote> You can
        understand what a change this is after being <factor type="battle">in the line</factor>. Just before I came on this job we
        had over a month <factor type="battle">in and out of the line</factor> waiting to <factor type="battle">go over the top</factor> when the <factor type="conditions">weather</factor> was
        favourable.</p>
      <p>We went in for four days then out for a rest for about three days then back again. The <factor type="conditions">water
        was over our knees</factor> in the <factor type="battle">trenches</factor> and it was <emote type="negative">impossible to use the <factor type="battle">communication trenches</factor>
        at all.</emote> We were holding the <factor type="battle">front line</factor> with <factor type="battle">two platoons</factor> (I should say our boys section of
        the line). <factor type="sense">Our platoon was twenty two strong</factor> including the Officer, and during the
        <factor type="battle">bombardment</factor> we had <factor type="trauma">eight put out in ten minutes</factor>. There were <factor type="conditions">no dugouts of any description</factor>
        there, so you can imagine what it was like to <factor type="conditions">stand there for four nights</factor>. <emote type="negative">We hoped the
        <factor type="conditions">weather</factor> would be alright so that we could <factor type="battle">go over and get it done with</factor> but it was not to be.</emote>
        We were out <factor type="prep">digging</factor> one night when they let us have it for five hours with <factor type="battle">gas shells</factor>, we
        had <factor type="trauma">two chaps hit with them and put right out.</factor>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="negative">The <factor type="sense">sights and smells</factor> were awful, as a good many of the <factor type="sense">chaps lay just as they fell</factor> during
        the advance.</emote>
         <emote type="negative"> It was impossible to <factor type="battle">bury</factor> them.</emote> Also there were about a <factor type="sense">dozen dead horses round</factor>
        about in the mud that were killed by <factor type="battle">shell fire</factor> while bringing up <factor type="battle">ammunition for the guns</factor>.
        Our <factor type="battle">guns</factor> never cease down there, as soon as one section stop, another lot open out so you
        can tell there is Somme noise.</p>
      <p>The last time we came out, was for <factor type="conditions">forty eight hours rest</factor> then <factor type="battle">in again and over</factor>, but the
        <emote type="negative">troops were in such a <factor type="trauma">bad condition</factor> that the doctor sent in a report saying we were not fit
        for the line</emote> so two other regiments in our division went over in our place.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">We were held in reserve and I am glad to say not required after all.</emote> Well I think this is
        about all, for now, I have been with the A.P. &amp; S.S. since December 1st and I can tell
        you, I hope I shall stop here.<emote type="neutral"> I have no desire to go back to the line.</emote> Kindly remember me
        to all old friends. With kind regards to yourself and all on Section 4.</p>

         <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>I expect you wonder what has become of me as you have not heard from me for such a long time.
        The reason is that since the 20th September I have been <factor type="trauma">suffering with enteric (typhoid)</factor>.
        The exact diagnosis of my case being <factor type="trauma">para typhoid B</factor>. I have not been up three weeks until
        next Friday, but <emote type="positive">since I first got out of bed I have made splendid progress.</emote> I was in an
        <factor type="conditions">isolation hospital in France</factor> for six weeks and previous to that <factor type="conditions">in a General Hospital</factor> for
        eight days. <emote type="positive">I arrived here late last Wednesday night after a very decent journey.</emote> This is a
        <factor type="sense">beautiful palace surrounded by a park</factor> in which we can walk about and we are allowed to go to
        the post office which is quite near. <emote type="positive">I am quite happy and comfortable here, it is a <factor type="conditions">splendid
        hospital</factor>.</emote> We have a <factor type="sense">concert or cinema nearly every night</factor> in the big hall. <factor type="conditions">Food is good</factor> and
        plentiful. <emote type="neutral">How long it will be before I am considered fit again I have no notion</emote>, as a rule
        it takes months for a person to get right again.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="negative">It is a very funny and beastly complaint.</emote>
         <emote type="positive">During to the whole time I have <factor type="conditions">been in hospital</factor> I
        have received every attention and kindness.</emote> During the months of July and August <emote type="negative">when I was
        in the Somme district I had a very rough time</emote>, was <emote type="negative">nearly worked to death</emote> and had <factor type="conditions">little
        sleep</factor>. At one period we had to commence work at 2am but we were supposed to rest in the day
        but we could not get any. <emote type="positive">However, it was all in a good cause and we got through it.</emote>
        Ambulance trains were loaded up at the station where I was and <factor type="sense">we saw some awful sights</factor>.
        <factor type="trauma">English and German wounded</factor>. Perhaps I <factor type="trauma">picked my fever up</factor> at this place, but one never knows.
        While I was in the <factor type="conditions">isolation hospital</factor> in France I was kept for three weeks and two days on
        liquids but <emote type="positive">I am pleased to say that the doctor has now put me on ordinary diet.</emote> With the

         <salute>My Dear Elton and all,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>I expect you are wondering why I have never written since leaving England. Well the fact is I
        have never had a chance for <emote type="neutral">it has been a Cooks Tour since I was last with you.gi</emote> Perhaps I
        had better try and give you some idea of my adventures from the time we last met. It was not
        many hours after seeing you all that we were dispatched for France. We landed at a town
        <emote type="positive">after a nice long trip.</emote>
         <emote type="negative">At this spot, a rest camp so called,</emote> we spent about a week. What
        with <factor type="prep">parades</factor> in the daytime for various reasons and <factor type="prep">employed at the docks</factor> all night,
        <factor type="prep">unloading flour</factor> was the job that came my way <emote type="negative">you can imagine the rest we had.</emote> However we
        then went on to another base and here owing to <factor type="trauma">illness</factor>, we were all <factor type="conditions">isolated</factor> for ten days
        and no letters could be sent. Within a day or two of being released from this I alone of all
        our boys was packed off to another depot so that was the last I have seen for the time being
        of our crowd, and have been on my own since. After a couple of nights at this depot I was
        sent to a point to <factor type="prep">get experience in the work</factor> I came here for. <emote type="positive">This turned out to be the
        best thing I had touched</emote> for the staff were billeted out and I slept in a <factor type="conditions">feather bed</factor> which
        was great for it was <factor type="conditions">under canvas</factor>.<emote type="positive">I soon found out that my luck was in and that happiness and comfort would be my lot</emote> whilst
        there. <emote type="negative">Alas my dream was soon dispelled</emote>, and after a week of civilised existence, I was sent
        for by the depot. After another 48 hours there I was sent away again to some other spot, but
        en route, was detained at a rest camp for two days, apparently owing to the <factor type="conditions">absence of 
        trains</factor> to the point I was going.</p>
      <p>Covered vans are used here to convey soldiers about. Strange to say the actual truck I made
        this last journey in I saw again the next day <factor type="sense">loaded with sick horses</factor>, so being used for any
        purpose you can guess they cannot be compared to the carriages in which we made our daily
        trips to town and back. To continue my travels, the next day I was sent to the point I am
        now writing from, and which I think will be my residence for some little time as I have now
        taken up <factor type="prep">regular duties</factor>. <emote type="negative">It is a terrible, Godforsaken and desolate spot.</emote> There is naught to
        be seen except <factor type="battle">shell holes</factor> and <emote type="negative">
            <factor type="conditions">rats</factor> and these latter are an abomination.</emote>
         <emote type="neutral">There is little to
        be heard here at night except <factor type="battle">gun fire</factor> and <factor type="conditions">rats</factor> and one soon gets used to both.</emote> I went to a
        village, the nearest here, about two miles away, on Sunday last and <emote type="negative">it was really an awful
        sight to see how it had been smashed by <factor type="battle">shell fire</factor>.</emote> You can now I trust realise the reason
        for my not writing before, in fact I have only written to my wife and father, and have only
        received one letter from each of them and that was a few days ago. I can tell you that <emote type="neutral">I
        hunger for news of home</emote> after being here a month without a word. It is also almost <emote type="negative">impossible
        to buy anything for there is nowhere to get it.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>I trust all is well with everyone at 164 and that poor old Sid is alright again. If Miss
        Welshs little affair has come off I wish her the very best of luck and trust she will have
        all happiness. Please write to me soon some of you. Lots of luck, and good wishes to you all. </p>

      <p>My address shows you I am well in now. <emote type="negative">Oh it is a different life and comes hard at first</emote>,
        <factor type="conditions">four blankets on the floor</factor> and it is hard. I didnt get used to it until last night which was
        my first nights proper rest. <emote type="negative">The food is fair but served very rough and not enough</emote> after the
        <factor type="prep">drills</factor> you have to go through. The <factor type="conditions">weather</factor> has of course been very bad and I am <factor type="conditions">still in the
        same things</factor> as I left London last Monday. <emote type="negative">I look like a tramp</emote> and my collar, of the colour,
        something like the office grate. I was <factor type="trauma">inoculated</factor> last Thursday but <emote type="neutral">was not so bad but some
        of the fellows felt it.</emote> I expect I shall have a time with the next lot but hope I dont as
        they have not got much sympathy and <emote type="negative">of course there is no comfort</emote>. A lot of fellows (about
        four hundred and fifty) have been shifted (Saturday and today) to Bordon and we shall all
        probably go when we get <factor type="prep">fitted out</factor> as they are making a new camp there with three new
        companies. <emote type="negative">It cannot be worse than here which is very dreary and lonely</emote> and the nearest
        village (Liss) is three miles away where several of us went on Saturday and Sunday and had
        tea. That place is I may say, truly rural. I have had a <factor type="sense">military hair cut</factor> tonight and feel
        that I look like Bill Sykes. <emote type="negative">I am afraid none of our young ladies would care to be seen
        walking up number 1 (platform at Paddington Station) with me as I look at the moment.</emote>
        (censored.)</p>
      <p>There is no leave now, only when you get your overseas leave which is generally after six
        weeks here and <emote type="negative">when you come back you are the put on the draft so it isnt long is it?</emote> George
        Jones and Isles will probably stay longer as they are to have false teeth but me, although
        as you know, I have got a very <factor type="trauma">bad lot of teeth</factor> was passed and they are not touching mine.
        Army ways are funny and I have already found out a lot of which I trust I shall one day be
        able to tell you.</p>
      <p>I forget to tell you we all got split up into different huts when we arrived and mine is
        about a mile away from the camp. <emote type="positive">It is very comfortable however much better <factor type="conditions">accommodation</factor>
        than at the camp.</emote> Three other of our fellows were put in there with me and I found some
        others, also some very nice London &amp; North Western Railway chaps, one of whom knew Mr
        Bryant and all the Fares office chaps. He was the head of the Season Ticket Office at
        Euston. I might say that <emote type="positive">they have been very good to me and assisted me more than some of
        our chaps</emote>, one or two of whom I am sorry to say have not done what they might to assist
        others and I (together with some of the others) have been surprised but of this more anon
        when we meet. Well I bid you all adieu for the present. I think of you all often and only
        <emote type="negative">wish I was back again</emote>
         <emote type="neutral">but it has to be done and one can only hope the end will come soon.</emote> I
        hope poor old Syd Douce is getting on alright as we have not heard how he is. Now good luck
        to you all and every success and tell them all that could go <emote type="negative">to keep out of this life as
        long as they can.</emote> Goodnight.</p>
      <p>I may say that four of our chaps who were lucky to get their outfit last week were moved to
        Bordon this afternoon: G. Holloway, Isles, Borrough, G.R.J. Jones.</p>

            tent up all right under the direction of one of the old heads who has seen service on
            the border. Some <factor type="prep">equipment</factor> was issued in the afternoon. As
            my name is down well in the list, I have not received anything yet in my own name.</p>
      <p>Corporal Hilton is staying in town so he let me have his stuff. Got pack, gun, poncho,
            and numerous <factor type="sense">other things I don't know what are used for</factor>.
                <factor type="conditions">Slept on the ground</factor> last night in a tent with
            just an <factor type="conditions">even dozen in it</factor>. Some of the fellows are
            staying in town at hotels, rooming houses, and private houses. Taken altogether, <emote type="negative">things are in rather poor shape as yet</emote>, but I suppose it
            takes a little time to get around. A few of the bunch act like a bunch of bums instead
            of soldiers, but they will get that taken out of them when they get to a real camp.</p>
      <p>They got Parker Melliush for kitchen duty the first thing. Walter Anthony was stuck for
            guard duty last night. It must be fine walking up and down in front of a row of tents
            watching the other fellows sleep. One thing they did do, everybody had to quiet down at
            ten-thirty last night. <emote type="positive">We had a good entertainment</emote> before
            lights out. (We had a light, too, as some of the bunch got hold of a <factor type="conditions">lantern</factor>.) A fellow in our squad by the name of Donald
                <factor type="sense">gets off some pretty good comedy</factor> -- original stuff,
            too. He is a rather rough nut, but not as bad as some of this crowd.</p>
      <p>There was some crowd at the station yesterday, wasn't there? I think I shook hands with
            everybody in town three or four times. <emote type="negative">Not a very pleasant task
                under the circumstances, either.</emote> Well, I got <emote type="negative">so much
                company in here that I can't think straight.</emote> This is rather a poor excuse of
            a letter, but I will write again soon.</p>

      <p> I write this on board a boat that will leave for overseas soon. Our letters are all
                <factor type="sense">censored from now on</factor> so there is no use wasting my
            time and the censor's trying to tell you some things.</p>
      <p>I took in a little of New York last night. I went into the city from Long Island by the
            way of the tube under the Hudson River. I got out at the Pennsylvania station and spent
            the rest of the night to 1:30 a.m. just looking around. <emote type="neutral">There
                wasn't any chance to go to a good show</emote> because you know how the advance
            sales take everything. Harry Lauder is at the Metropolitan and <emote type="neutral">I
                would certainly like to have seen him.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>I saw where the film "The Beast of Berlin" was being shown and right across the street
            was Arthur Guy Empey, "Over the Top".</p>
      <p>The city is <factor type="sense">full of soldiers and sailors all the time</factor>, I
            guess. Anyway there were a good many last night.</p>
      <p>The city is an easy place to get lost because of the <factor type="sense">irregularity of
                the streets</factor>. Most all streets out our way cross each other at angles but in
            N.Y. they may take any direction. I walked down one street and when I took a notion to
            turn and go back, I wasn't on the same street at all and I couldn't tell where I made
            any turn.</p>
      <p>I got a <factor type="sense">good look at the city from the waterfront today</factor>. It
            was <factor type="conditions">a bright clear day</factor> and we could see quite a
            distance. I have seen pictures of N.Y. from the Hudson and I can say that the real thing
            was just a picture laid before you. <emote type="neutral">I would like to have stayed at
                Camp Mills until I had seen more of the city but the powers that be see
                otherwise.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>
         <emote type="neutral">I can scarcely realize we are going.</emote> Everything moves off
            without any trouble or delay that it might just as well be a trip up the river.</p>
      <p>Well, <emote type="positive">I have been looking forward to this for quite a
                while</emote> and I guess, now that the time for going has come, it fits right into
            my scheme and ways of thinking that the going seems only a small part of it.</p>
      <p>Well, I must close so as to mail this right away so, goodbye little girl for a time at
            least. Keep on writing.</p>

      <p>I received my first mail since I have gotten across yesterday. Two <factor type="sense">letters</factor> from you are dated April 19 and the other April 22. The first one
            was written before you had heard my N.Y. address and the other was addressed to Camp
            Mills. <emote type="positive">They were indeed highly appreciated letters</emote> and I
            believe that I can look for more right soon as the mail has begun to come now. There
            were <factor type="sense">two other letters</factor> for me also; one from Mother and
            Ethel . the other from James.Probably James Gasaway, a boyhood friend. The last was of
            the most recent date: May 6. <emote type="positive">This was certainly an excited
                company when we found out there was <factor type="sense">so much mail</factor> for
                us.</emote>
         <emote type="positive">Almost everyone got <factor type="sense">at least one
                    letter</factor> and a few were as fortunate as myself.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>I was rather surprised to hear that Robert was going into the R.F.C. although you had
            told me of it, too. But to know that he had already left for camp and by the time you
            get this letter he will probably be in England was just a bit of a surprise. <emote type="positive">Well, I am glad that he is in the service</emote> but, of course,
                <emote type="neutral">I would like to have seen him in a uniform of the
                U.S.A.</emote>
         <emote type="positive">It is all one cause, however, and we are comrades just the same
                whether American, English, or what.</emote> I have <factor type="sense">seen some
                mighty fine men from Britain</factor> just what short time I have been here. (My pen
            went dry and I haven't any ink at my elbow as I did in U.S.) Speaking of the English,
                <emote type="positive">it is wonderful how men can go through three and four years
                of this war and still be <factor type="sense">smiling, cheerful, good-natured
                    fellows</factor>,</emote> but they are. I agree with Robert when he says there
            will be two classes of men in America after the war -- the ones who went, and the ones
            who did not. And I believe as he does the ones who went are going to be the ones who
            will have charge of affairs when they get back for, <emote type="neutral">if a man
                stands this war and still comes out smiling, he is a man.</emote>
         <emote type="positive">I certainly hope I may have a chance of seeing Robert over
                here</emote> but it would be only an accident I am afraid. Let me know his address
            from time to time so if there is any way of seeing him, I will do all I can to find
            him.</p>
      <p>You must have a nice home now and right in your old neighborhood. And those fruit trees
            take my eye. I believe I could consume your total production right now. Some of these
            times we will sample that fruit and also stroll over to Swope Park and look things over
            considerably after the war, apres la guerre, as the French say. Whenever you say
            anything to them about certain things they can't do now, <emote type="negative">they
                always say "after the war," and I think that little expression shows to what
                extremes they are willing to go in <factor type="sense">self
                sacrifice</factor>.</emote>
         <emote type="positive"> I certainly have a very high
                opinion of the French.</emote> They are most <factor type="sense">highly respected
                by the American soldiers and they return the compliment</factor>.</p>
      <p>To sit here where I am now, <emote type="neutral">it seems scarcely possible that we are
                so <factor type="conditions">near the front</factor>.</emote> This country here is a
                <factor type="sense">peaceful-looking farming country</factor> and, to look out over
            the quiet fields, <emote type="neutral">it is hard to realize that the <factor type="battle">fighting</factor> is so close at hand.</emote> To walk across
            these fields is just like taking a stroll over Dad's farm on some quiet Sunday
            afternoon. Only there are several things that are conspicuously absent -- most of all
            the folks that were left behind. The ones that you love and are loved by is what goes to
            make life worthwhile.</p>
      <p>Well, the sound of the <factor type="battle">big guns</factor> somewhere not so many
            miles away has begun again. Sometimes the sound comes from one side, then the other,
            until it is hard to tell which way one could go and not find someone <factor type="battle">shooting</factor> at someone else. My address is the same: Co. K,
            137th Inf., Amer. E.F. I expect you know it by this time but some of my letters may drop
            by the wayside so it is best to be sure for I certainly want to get all the mail that is
            coming to me.</p>
      <p>So, goodbye to the little girl who has given up two loved ones so cheerfully and sent
            them away with the smile that counts.</p>

      <postscript>P.S. I have received another letter from you since I wrote the fore part of this
            letter. It was dated April 25. Also I got one from Mother dated May 10. It was marked
            No. 2.... suppose No. 1 was sidetracked somewhere along the line. This is the second
            letter I have written you since going into our billets The other was not dated at all,
            maybe this one won't be when you get it but I am risking it anyway. Mother said my first
            letter written on the boat got by without being cut up. It had no cause for being cut up
            as I said almost nothing as most of my letters do, but wait until I can tell you. I will
            have some tale. Well, goodnight sweetheart, Lloyd</postscript>

      <p>It is about time to write again and, <emote type="positive">as I feel rather in the humor
                and have the time</emote>, I will proceed without any further delay.</p>
      <p>I am still in the same place as I told you in the last letter -- at the Brigade post
            office and the <factor type="sense">four of us are the only ones left</factor> in this
            town. I mean Americans, of course. <emote type="neutral">We are having quite a time as
                we are our own cooks</emote> and are ruled by our own sweet wills. <emote type="negative">I can't say that it will be so pleasant, though, if we are here for
                a few days more than we are expecting.</emote>
         <factor type="conditions">Anything to
                eat</factor> is awfully hard to get, especially if you are a soldier. The Army is
            supposed to feed us, you know, and everything outside the Army is for civilians and God
            knows they need what little they can get. The people here, two or three men, <factor type="sense">cleaned up the building used for storage of supplies in order to get
                what might be left behind</factor>. They thought they made a good bargain, too, and
            I suppose the Americans did leave more than the French ever do.</p>
      <p>Oh yes, I meant to tell you what we had for <factor type="conditions">breakfast</factor>
            and all this was cooked by the corporal in charge and what assistance I could give. We
            had fried eggs, we bought some from a Frenchwoman, steak, Army issue, we got a
            half-cooked chunk of beef from the Company we ate with, butter or oleo, strawberry jam,
            bread, and coffee. Bread was Army bread, white bread, too, and about one hundred percent
            better than the French people eat. <emote type="neutral">That was not so bad, was it,
                for an Army meal.</emote>
         <emote type="negative">I only wish I could have one like it every day.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>Our office is right next to the schoolhouse and we often talk with the schoolmaster, make
            signs or any other way to <factor type="sense">communicate</factor>. They have separate
            rooms for boys and girls over here and the <factor type="sense">children that get to
                school at this place are no larger than would compare with our attendants of the
                third or fourth grade.</factor> I don't know whether that is as far as they expect
            the children to go or not. The schoolroom looks a great deal like any schoolroom. The
            benches or seats are longer than ours -- they must seat two or three together. The room
            has an abundance of maps, pictures, and blackboards. They seem to study the geography of
            France but little of any other part of the world. <emote type="positive">We were much
                interested in the map of France</emote> as we wished to see where we had been in our
            journey and I must say I was very much surprised at how much we had really covered. I
            sure want to tell you all about it one of these days. Just take that big map we so often
            have studied and talk until we can't talk anymore and then just take you in my arms and
            kiss those sweet rosy lips again. Well, they talk of the girl that was left behind, for
            my part I can see you just as plain as I ever did and you look a thousand times more
            dear to me now and <emote type="positive">someday we will be the happiest boy and girl
                that there possibly can be anywhere in the world.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>I haven't had a letter from you for over a week now but <emote type="negative">I can't
                get my mail as I should.</emote> It goes out to the Company and I can't get to the
            Company. This idea of working in a post office and then can't get your own mail is some
            idea. I am going to have you send my letters directed to the 69th Brigade, P.O. 35th
            Division, American Expeditionary Forces. Then if I change again soon, I will immediately
            let you know.</p>
      <p>Well, it is getting close to dinnertime and <emote type="neutral">I must help get <factor type="conditions">dinner</factor> -- we are regular cooks now.</emote> Tell me
            all and everything that you possibly can write as I sure love to read your <factor type="sense">letters</factor> more than anything else, unless it is writing ones for
            you to read.</p>
      <p>By the way, I read that story in the <factor type="sense">April American</factor>
            yesterday. <emote type="positive">It was the luckiest thing I ever got hold of
                one.</emote> You asked me to read "Pictures Burned in My Memory" I believe and I
            must say that, as far as I have gone in this business, that story certainly tells the
            straight stuff. I used to think that a lot of such stories were written by men with
            highly colored imaginations but I see now that they could tell even more and still be
            speaking the truth.</p>
      <p>This must be "fini" or I will miss out on the <factor type="conditions">eats</factor> and
            that can't be done with impunity in the Army. So, goodbye for a little while my own

      <p>Well, I have had another <factor type="sense">letter</factor> from you since I wrote
            last. This one was dated June 30. It takes about that much time, it seems, for a letter
            to get to us. Also, I had one from Mother of about the same date. You two seem to write
            about the same dates every time and when I get a letter from one, I can almost always
            expect one from the other right soon.</p>
      <p>We have moved again but not far this time. Moved on my favorite moving day, Sunday, or
            rather the day the Army has picked for me so many times. We have our office in <factor type="conditions">an old barn</factor> of some sort. <emote type="neutral">Quite a
                drop from sorting mail on a billiard table.</emote> The <factor type="conditions">floor is so rickety</factor> here that <emote type="negative">we are in danger of
                going through every time we make any movements.</emote>
         <emote type="positive">Also, I may say the <factor type="conditions">ventilating
                    system</factor> is good -- extra good -- and the <factor type="conditions">elevator</factor> going down is in perfect working order.</emote> I forgot to
            state our office was on the second floor. The <factor type="conditions">lighting
                system</factor> is rather poor, though. I intend to see the landlord about it soon
            but <emote type="neutral">I am afraid we would have a hard time "comprening" each other
                and I don't know the <factor type="sense">sign language</factor> for more light
                yet.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>I just came from K Co. and <emote type="positive">everyone there seems to be in <factor type="sense">good health and the best of spirits</factor>.</emote> Brought a
            letter back for Shoemaker, to go out tomorrow. Shoey is working in the kitchen now and,
            from all appearances, he is getting lots to eat. I suppose they will be moving up to the
                <factor type="battle">trenches</factor> again as soon as they have been out the
            usual time.</p>
      <p>I am going to send you an issue of the <factor type="sense">Stars and Stripes</factor> as
            soon as I have finished reading it. This is the A.E.F. paper and I think that you will
            be pleased to see what sort of a paper it is. This paper is not the regular newspapers
            we get but sort of a sheet that reflects the A.E.F. spirit. Our news sources are the
                <factor type="sense">Paris edition of the N.Y. Herald</factor>, <factor type="sense">Chicago Tribune</factor>, and the <factor type="sense">Daily Mail</factor>. The
            last is an English paper put out by the London Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>Found where there is a ruin of an <factor type="sense">old castle</factor> and as soon as
            I find the time I am going to see what there is to see there. It is on a small hill that
            rises rather abruptly out of the valley and, from the looks of things from the ground,
            it is indeed a hard place to reach even now. Those old timers were fond of such sites I
            have been told. The fellow that picked this place, picked a good one, too.</p>
      <p>Heard from Doug a few days before I got your last letter. He seems to be in the best of
            spirits and he hears from Joe I. occasionally, too. He says she is in Washington D.C.
            working for my able employer. Well, he has a lot of jobs open, it seems, from the way

      <p>Oh! I must tell you I saw Becker a night or so ago. He showed me a <factor type="sense">letter</factor> he had from Robert and, as a return favor, I gave him the one I had

      <p>Well, it is getting late so I suppose it would be best for me to ring off for this time.

         <salute>Dear Mr Hunt,</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>Thanks very much for your letter which I received a week or two ago, also for the
        magazine.</p>
      <p>We are in the <factor type="battle">trenches</factor> just now. In fact <emote type="negative">we seem to spend about three times as much time in as we do out.</emote>
        Also we are in a pretty <factor type="battle">warm spot</factor>, it was about here, towards
        the end of last summer that the French and German had some of the fiercest fighting of the
        war. The country around about is a <factor type="battle">veritable maze of
        trenches</factor>. <emote type="negative">The fighting at one time was so fierce that there
            was only time just to bury the dead</emote> in the sides of the trenches, and now that
        the <factor type="conditions">trenches have crumpled</factor> one is constantly <factor type="sense">seeing the bones of mens legs or their boots</factor>, or <factor type="sense">skulls</factor> sticking out from the sides of the trenches, pleasant, eh?
            <emote type="negative">There will be a pleasant smell here in the summer.</emote>
         <emote type="neutral">I only hope we are not here then.</emote> In places we are only about
        twenty yards away from Fritz and company. Consequently all times the air is pretty thick
        with <factor type="battle">bombs</factor>, <factor type="battle">grenades</factor> and
            <factor type="battle">trench mortars.</factor> These last are pretty hellish sort of
        toys. They have <factor type="sense">an explosion like about ten earthquakes</factor> rolled
        into one. <emote type="negative">But even these are not the worst we have to put up
            with.</emote> The trenches being so close together there is of course any amount of
            <factor type="battle">mining</factor> going on. <emote type="neutral">So one never knows
            when the particular lump of earth one is standing on is going to take a trip through the
            solar regions.</emote> When a <factor type="battle">mine</factor> does go up, <emote type="negative">there is some excitement knocking about I can tell you.</emote> Suppose
        for instance we were going to explode one, all the <factor type="battle">artillery</factor>
        in the neighbourhood is ranged on the spot and directly the <factor type="battle">mine is
            exploded</factor>, there is hell let loose on the crater. Of course as soon as he gets
        the range the <factor type="battle">enemy replies</factor>, so that <factor type="sense">the
            air is fairly full of everything that kills quickly</factor>. <emote type="negative">One
            can on these occasions always rely on a good many casualties.</emote> Since we have been
        in this spasm there have been <factor type="battle">five exploded</factor> in this
        neighbourhood, while others are expected to go up at any time. <emote type="neutral">So much
            for conditions here.</emote>
      </p>
      <p>How is everything in town? Pretty quiet I suppose. I see youve had the zepps (Zeppelins) over
        again? Is it a fact that one dropped in the Thames? (Lines censored.) That is about all the
        news, so will close, kindest regards to everybody.</p>

      </opener>
      <p>Your very welcome letter to hand a couple of days ago.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="positive">I am pleased to hear that the strike is settled</emote> and that you lost no time. Well Jack you say
        that there seems to be a bit of a mystery about us chaps well since the <factor type="prep">evacuation</factor>, last
        December we have been tossed about a bit &amp; have had <factor type="prep">three trips across the Meditterean</factor>
        so I reckon that I have been pretty lucky in not meeting any German submarines.</p>
      <p>My last trip was from Alexandria to Marceilles, which took six days and then straight out of
        the boat into the train for another 68 hours ride across France. <emote type="positive">My word Jack it was a
        lovely <factor type="conditions">train journey</factor>
         </emote> we passed through some beautiful country but I will tell you all about
        it when I get home again but its hard to say when that will be. Well Jack this is Easter
        Monday we are moving into the <factor type="battle">trenches</factor> tonight so we will be able to find out for our-selves
        what sort of fighters the Germans are perhaps I will be able to tell you a bit about them in
        my next letter.</p>
      <p>Well Jack you dont mention what batt your Brother is attached to so next time you write dont
        forget to let me know as I would only be to pleased to meet him. I say Jack you will have to
        excuse scribbling as I haven't much time so I will have to close with best wishes to
        yourself and wife and all the engine room staff.</p>

      <p>I guess you wonder what has become of me after this long silence, but you will see I am a

        department is also here. It is rather strange that I should rub against him.</p>
      <p>The <factor type="conditions">weather is brilliant</factor>, cloudless skies day after day, but it is <factor type="conditions">very hot</factor>. There are plenty
        of <factor type="conditions">mosquitoes</factor> about. They are very tantalising. A net is practically a necessity for
        sleeping purposes. I am <factor type="conditions">billeted in a warehouse</factor>, it is a <factor type="sense">very old place</factor>, and has stood
        hundreds of years. I should think, according to its general appearance.</p>
      <p>I have not picked up the lingo yet, but French is chiefly spoken, and <emote type="neutral">I much regret not
        having studied it more when I had the opportunity at home.</emote> This town is a queer sort of
        place as compared with some of the French towns we know, and am sure <emote type="negative">I shall not wish to see
        it again when once I leave.</emote> The cafs are not so gay as the French, but <emote type="positive">I manage to have fun
        occasionally.</emote> We have got a <factor type="sense">piano and gramophone</factor> to amuse ourselves with. I hope we shall be
        able to have another trip to Paris, when the war has cleared up, but of course when is a
        question nobody can answer yet awhile. Shall be very pleased to hear some news of you, and

      <p>The last time I wrote I think I told you <emote type="neutral">we had lost our comfortable
            job on railheads.</emote> We have been shifted from General Headquarters and are at the
        <emote type="negative">most godforsaken hole there can possibly be in France.</emote>
         <emote type="negative">We had a
            rotten journey <factor type="conditions">raining</factor> all the time.</emote>
        Reveille* was at 4am and we eventually left the station about 10am. The accommodation
        consisted of the <factor type="conditions">old cattle trucks</factor>, and <factor type="conditions">rations of bully and biscuits</factor>. It was a <factor type="sense">very cold and uncomfortable journey</factor>.</p>
      <p>We arrived at our destination about 4.30pm and after standing in the <factor type="conditions">rain</factor> for 2 hours with full pack on, we set out on a <factor type="prep">ten mile march</factor>. <emote type="negative">Its the worst march Ive ever
            done.</emote> The majority of us at the finish were absolutely knocked up and were only
        too glad to crawl into the billets before going to bed, which was about 12pm. They gave us a
            <factor type="conditions">mug of tea</factor> (the first we had since six in the
        morning) and best of all a <factor type="conditions">ration of rum</factor>.</p>
      <p>The up to date soldier kit to carry about from place to place consists of 150 rounds of
        ammunition, <factor type="sense">inside the pack; overcoat, fur coat, two pairs socks, one pants, one shirt,
        ground sheet, iron rations [emergency food supply]</factor>. <factor type="sense">Outside pack; Mackintosh and mess tin,
        in haversack; cleaning kit, hold all, 24lbs rations, soap and towel, and on top of that
        extras such as handkerchiefs, plate, mug, tobacco, etc, two smoke helmets* in a satchel
        slung over the shoulder, a respirator in the left flap of a tunic and field dressing on the
        right, and of course the rifle,</factor>
         <emote type="negative">in all its no light weight on a long
            march</emote>, it takes all ones strength and staying power to keep going. </p>
      <p>We are billeted in a barn and have <factor type="conditions">a sea of mud</factor> to get
        through. We have no boards, <factor type="conditions">so sleep on the ground</factor>, fires
        are not allowed in the billet and at night time its <factor type="conditions">devilish
            cold</factor>.</p>
      <p>In the village there is a <factor type="sense">little general shop</factor> (now nearly sold
        out), one pub where they sell something they charge 2d for and call beer, there are no shops
        of any description and of course no amusements.</p>
      <p>
         <emote type="negative">Rations are not so good now</emote> (todays dinner, Sunday, bully
        beef, stew and two potatoes between 35 men. We have a loaf and a bit (small loaf) and two
        tins of jam between seven men, the <factor type="conditions">short bread issue</factor>
        being augmented by the <factor type="conditions">world famous army biscuits</factor>.</p>
      <p>Our captain is a perfect gentleman and about the most popular man in the regiment, the junior
        captain (an absolute sport) and the platoon officers are all very decent sort of fellows.
            <emote type="positive">We appear to be much better off in this respect than
            before</emote>, and certainly think that D. Co. has got as good a selection of officers
        as any other company in the battalion. One of our fellows ran across a number of Audit R.E.s
        and they enquired after Maggs and myself. </p>
