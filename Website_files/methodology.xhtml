                <p class="content"> For this project, our markup centered around the identification
                    of emotive statements and war-time factors. Our aim was to build a relationship
                    between the overall sentiment of the letter (representative of the soldier's
                    mental state on a given time), the way the writer expressed his emotions, and
                    the experiences he had during the war.</p>
                <p class="content">As long as a soldier had paper and a pencil, he counted them
                    among his few possessions. So what did our soldiers send home to their loved
                    ones?</p>

                <h2 class="content">Emotive Statements:</h2>
                <p class="content"> The writer expressing some kind of feeling, judgement, or
                    emotional remark. Emotive statements can be explicit or implied, but must convey
                    an emotion that is classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Ex: "We have
                    had quite a good time and the regular hours and regular meals have backed
                    everyone up well and now we are all as fit as ever apparently." War-time
                    factors: Experiences related to the war reported by the writer, either involving
                    the author or his immediate group.</p>

                <h2 class="content">Factor Groups:</h2>
                <ul class="content">
                    <li class="con"><strong>Trauma:</strong> physical injuries, sickness, or death.
                        Ex: "awful bruises", "weight"</li>
                    <li class="con"><strong>Battle:</strong> physical conflict, fights, gunfire,
                        shellfire. Ex: "bomb", "gas shells", "trenches"</li>
                    <li class="con"><strong>Prep:</strong> activities related to preparing for
                        deployment, such as training, travel, receiving supplies, and relocation.
                        Ex: "route march", "parades", "signalling"</li>
                    <li class="con"><strong>Conditions:</strong> living conditions, food, weather,
                        access to amenities. Ex: "rather rough journey", "lousy(infested with
                        lice)"</li>
                    <li class="con"><strong>Sense:</strong> other experiences which a soldier can
                        see, hear, smell, or taste. Used as a category for "other" noteworthy
                        happenings which do not fit into the first four groups, such as getting mail
                        from home. Ex: "one thousand seven hundred men on board" "gets off some
                        pretty good comedy"</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="content">Our methodology will provide quantitative data for comparing
                    overall emotive sentiment with a proportion of factors reported. The
                    relationship between wartime factors and emotion provides perspective into a
                    soldier's mental wellbeing.</p>
